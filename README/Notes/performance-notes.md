# Performance Notes

This note tracks the performance numbers that matter for users: **end-to-end wall time for one `pipe.synthesize(...)` request** using the current repo HAR-post packages versus the baseline packages downloaded from [mattmireles/kokoro-coreml on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mattmireles/kokoro-coreml).

## What was measured

- **Candidate:** local repo packages in `coreml/`
- **Baseline:** downloaded HF packages in `outputs/hf_baseline/coreml/`
- **Artifacts compared:** `kokoro_decoder_har_post_3s.mlpackage` and `kokoro_decoder_har_post_10s.mlpackage`
- **Metric:** full wall clock around `pipe.synthesize(text, voice="af_heart", speed=1.0)`

These numbers include:

- text processing / `extract_vocoder_inputs()`
- CPU-side tensor prep
- Core ML dispatch and waiting inside the HAR-post call
- trim and Python orchestration
- final waveform returned to the caller

These numbers do **not** include:

- process startup
- model download
- application-level audio playback

## External Bakeoff: surgical Core ML vs MLX and iOS/Core ML Kokoro

**Collected:** 2026-06-05
**Status:** Complete; signed iPhone execution ingested, waveform sanity passed,
human listening decisions recorded, and final completion verifier passed.

This bakeoff compares the current Swift + Core ML Config F reference against
popular Apple Silicon Kokoro implementations:

- **MLX:** `Blaizzy/mlx-audio`, pinned clone
  `862dfbe5338e91df6f74ac986b4df8bede7961a6`, package version
  `mlx-audio 0.4.3`, model `mlx-community/Kokoro-82M-bf16`.
- **Primary iOS/Core ML comparator:** `soniqo/speech-swift`, pinned clone
  `0d09a2ed5464c7c94cf4545be59043c21f8775ea`, using
  `KokoroTTSModel.fromPretrained(computeUnits: .all)`.
- **Long-bucket Core ML backup:** `laishere/kokoro-coreml`, pinned clone
  `484907db6a8347a6afb6e7b86850ea2878c6a3fb`.

`mlalma/kokoro-ios` was excluded from the primary table because its public
package is MLX Swift, not Core ML. ONNX, GGML, browser, cloud, and non-Kokoro
engines were out of scope.

### Method

The shared manifest uses the shipped runtime buckets: `3s`, `7s`, `10s`,
`15s`, and `30s`. All adapters requested voice `af_heart`. The full sweeps
record one cold call followed by five warm calls; explicitly marked targeted
reruns record ten warm calls for the named bucket. The warm table reports the
median warm wall time. RTF uses the observed emitted audio duration, not the
nominal bucket label.

The intended timing boundary is from immediately before the implementation's
synthesis call or CLI invocation until full PCM audio is materialized in memory.
Config F, MLX, and Soniqo follow that boundary. laishere's public benchmark
boundary excludes G2P and feed preparation and times only the seven-stage Core
ML chain; those numbers are therefore useful as a Core ML chain comparison, but
not a fully equivalent end-to-end TTS boundary.

The paper-facing comparison is warmed inference only. Cold calls, Core ML AOT
compile, model load, cache fill, and any first-use stall are retained as
operational evidence, but excluded from ranking, speedup, and thesis tables.
The current Config F rows use the production-shaped staged policy
(`duration`/`F0Ntrain`/generator on CPU+GPU, decoder-pre on CPU+ANE), exact
duration model discovery, and three discarded preflight calls before recorded
warm calls. The earlier `--compute-units all` + padded-duration rows are kept
below as historical cold-start/operational evidence, not as the paper-facing
inference comparison. After the HnSF vDSP optimization and direct HAR-padding
fast path, the `m2-air` `3s`, `7s`, and `30s` cells and the `m2-studio` `30s`
cell use single-bucket N=10 reruns with the same preflight policy because the
corresponding full-sweep cells showed generator-level run-to-run variance.
Other Config F cells are N=5 full-sweep medians.

### iPhone Status

The connected iPhone 12 Pro is visible to CoreDevice as `Webcam`
(`F383FC46-FD64-5346-AEC6-59E3E2F8C9CA`, model `iPhone13,3`, UDID
`00008101-001134561A0A001E`) and is connected, paired, and running with
Developer Mode enabled. The minimal Soniqo Kokoro iOS runner in
`scripts/external_bakeoff/SoniqoKokoroIOSRunner/` was built with automatic
signing, installed, launched, run on device, and ingested into
`outputs/external_bakeoff/results_soniqo_speech_swift_kokoro_ios_iphone-12-pro.json`.
The runner uses the shared runtime manifest (`3s`, `7s`, `10s`, `15s`, `30s`)
and records one cold call plus five warmed inference calls per bucket with
observed-duration RTF.

#### iphone-12-pro

The iPhone 3s cold call was `10866.3 ms`, reflecting first-use model setup. The
7s, 10s, 15s, and 30s cold calls were `867.7 ms`, `891.4 ms`, `883.1 ms`, and
`925.2 ms` respectively. As on macOS, Soniqo emits `2.7s` for the 3s input and
`5.0s` for each longer manifest input, so the iPhone long-bucket numbers are
device execution evidence for the public Soniqo artifact, not full-duration
7s/10s/15s/30s parity evidence.

Whisper, ASR, VAD, playback, and echo-demo dependencies are not part of this
bakeoff boundary. The iOS runner is intentionally Kokoro TTS only.

### Consolidated Warm Median and RTF by Platform

Each cell is `warm median wall time / observed RTF`. These are steady-state
post-prime inference medians; cold and compile-inclusive timings are not
eligible for this table.

### Config F Speed Ratio

Values are comparator warm median divided by Config F warm median, using only
steady-state post-prime inference cells. Values above `1.0x` mean Config F was
faster. Values below `1.0x` mean the comparator was faster.

### Config F Fast-Path Correction

The first completed external bakeoff table measured Config F with
`kokoro-bench --compute-units all` and mostly padded duration models. That
configuration made Core ML solve large padded duration graphs before the
generator ran. On M2 Studio, the duration stage alone accounted for about
`81.8 ms`, `153.9 ms`, `373.7 ms`, `417.8 ms`, and `732.7 ms` across the
`3s`, `7s`, `10s`, `15s`, and `30s` rows. That was the immediate reason MLX
looked faster: MLX used a fused Metal path while Config F was paying avoidable
Core ML graph-dispatch and padded-duration cost.

The production-shaped Swift policy is exposed as
`kokoro-bench --compute-units staged`: duration, F0Ntrain, and generator load
with `.cpuAndGPU`, while decoder-pre loads with `.cpuAndNeuralEngine`. The
external Config F adapter now defaults to this staged policy and enables exact
duration model discovery by default. With the missing
`kokoro_duration_exact_t156.mlpackage` generated for the `10s` fixture, the
corrected warm medians after the vDSP HnSF optimization and direct HAR-padding
fast path are:

| Machine | 3s | 7s | 10s | 15s | 30s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| m2-studio | 60.2 ms | 110.5 ms | 149.6 ms | 222.6 ms | 449.0 ms |
| m2-air | 151.7 ms | 335.0 ms | 474.6 ms | 704.7 ms | 1430.0 ms |
| irvine-m1 | 239.2 ms | 510.2 ms | 700.7 ms | 1028.9 ms | 1977.7 ms |

This corrected run flips the MLX comparison for every MLX-comparable Mac
bucket across all three hardware platforms. It also beats Soniqo's valid `3s`
macOS cell on every Mac and beats laishere on every M2 Studio cell. The
remaining negative rows are important: laishere's narrower Core ML-chain-only
boundary is still faster on M2 Air and M1 short/medium buckets, though the gap
is now small on M2 Air and Config F now wins the M2 Air and M1 `30s` laishere
rows. Soniqo's 5s-only public artifact remains faster than full-duration Config
F for the 30s row because it emits much less audio. The exact duration package
set, including
`kokoro_duration_exact_t156.mlpackage`, still needs to be published with the
model artifacts for third-party reproduction.

#### Corrected Config F stage medians

Each cell is the median per-stage time from the corrected staged + exact
current-code run. The generator remains the dominant cost on M2 Air and M1; the
Swift HnSF step is the second largest long-bucket cost on all machines.

#### Vectorized HnSF Gaussian noise

The Swift HnSF path still used a scalar Box-Muller loop for Gaussian noise even
after the vDSP STFT/vectorization pass. Replacing the scalar transcendental
work with vectorized `vForce`/`vDSP` math preserves the same seeded RNG draw
order and leaves the final waveform inside the existing parity tolerance.

Matched local M2 Studio control: scalar `HEAD` (`3a2e083`) was built in a
temporary worktree and compared against the vectorized candidate with the same
models, inputs, `KOKORO_USE_EXACT_DURATION_MODELS=1`, `--compute-units staged`,
`--warmup 2`, and `--iterations 5`.

| Input | Scalar wall | Vector wall | Wall delta | Scalar HnSF | Vector HnSF | HnSF delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3s | 72.9 ms | 72.4 ms | +0.7% | 10.4 ms | 8.4 ms | +19.2% |
| 7s | 131.1 ms | 125.9 ms | +3.9% | 24.9 ms | 19.8 ms | +20.6% |
| 10s | 165.6 ms | 160.3 ms | +3.2% | 34.5 ms | 28.5 ms | +17.5% |
| 15s | 278.7 ms | 253.6 ms | +9.0% | 56.4 ms | 45.5 ms | +19.3% |
| 30s | 490.3 ms | 459.9 ms | +6.2% | 109.5 ms | 88.6 ms | +19.0% |

Parity check against the pre-change `30s` tensor dump passed for
`har_source`, `har_magnitude`, `har_phase`, `har`, `har_padded`, `waveform`,
and `waveform_full` with no failing boundary. Final waveform correlation was
`0.999997` with max abs `0.00274658`; the HnSF boundary tensors were
correlation `1.0`.

#### Direct HAR padding fast path

Current `main` avoids constructing a temporary HAR `MLMultiArray` before
padding the generator input. It pads the flat Swift-built HAR buffer directly
into the final `(1, 22, targetTime)` array and returns the source `x_pre`
unchanged when it already matches `(1, 512, targetTime)`. This removes one
full HAR copy and one no-op `x_pre` copy from the generator boundary without
changing model inputs.

The largest current-code win was the M2 Air `30s` path, where the targeted
N=10 warm median moved from `1511.5 ms` in the vDSP-only snapshot to
`1430.0 ms`. Other cells are mostly neutral to modestly faster, which is
consistent with the generator model prediction itself still dominating the
wall clock.

#### Generator isolation evidence

`kokoro-bench --generator-input-dump` now supports repeated warm generator
predictions against a previously dumped Swift tensor boundary:

```bash
swift/.build/release/kokoro-bench \
  --models-dir coreml \
  --inputs-dir outputs/swift_bench_inputs \
  --hnsf-weights outputs/swift_bench_inputs/hnsf_weights.json \
  --generator-input-dump outputs/generator_isolation/dumps/7s \
  --compute-units cpuAndGPU \
  --warmup 3 \
  --iterations 10 \
  --output outputs/generator_isolation/results/generator_7s_cpuAndGPU.json
```

The result files are ignored under `outputs/generator_isolation/`; they are
stage-isolation evidence, not paper table rows. Each value below is the N=10
median after three discarded warmups, using the exact `x_pre_padded`, `ref_s`,
and `har_padded` tensors emitted by the current Swift pipeline.

| Machine | Input | `cpuAndGPU` | `.all` | `cpuAndNeuralEngine` | `cpuOnly` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| m2-studio | 3s | 27.2 ms | 27.0 ms | 1535.5 ms | 100.9 ms |
| m2-studio | 7s | 59.5 ms | 60.3 ms | not rerun | not rerun |
| m2-air | 3s | 120.1 ms | 155.4 ms | not rerun | not rerun |
| m2-air | 7s | 277.6 ms | 426.2 ms | not rerun | not rerun |
| irvine-m1 | 3s | 168.9 ms | 172.8 ms | not rerun | not rerun |
| irvine-m1 | 7s | 384.7 ms | 394.2 ms | not rerun | not rerun |

This isolates the generator as the dominant Config F stage and rules out an
incorrect compute-unit policy for the current `GeneratorFromHar` package. On
the two lower-end Macs, `.all` is slower than explicit `cpuAndGPU`; on M2
Studio, `.all` merely ties `cpuAndGPU`. Forcing CPU+ANE is catastrophic even at
3s. This does not by itself prove laishere's generator-equivalent chain is
faster; it proves our current fused generator is the main place where a
same-boundary optimization could move the full-pipeline table.

#### Exact generator geometry probe

`scripts/probe_generator_exact_geometry.py` tests a tempting shortcut: export
`GeneratorFromHar` at the observed trimmed audio length instead of the padded
bucket length, then run it against cropped tensors from the current Swift
generator dumps. The generated packages and reports are ignored under
`outputs/generator_exact_geometry/`.

Local M2 Studio results, `cpuAndGPU`, N=10 median after three discarded
warmups:

| Source dump | Exact output | `x_pre` time | HAR time | Warm generator median | Corr vs current trimmed | SNR | Max abs | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 3s | 2.800s / 67,200 samples | 224 | 26,881 | 27.1 ms | 0.927 | 8.87 dB | 0.240 | reject |
| 7s | 6.750s / 162,000 samples | 540 | 64,801 | 55.7 ms | 0.952 | 10.73 dB | 0.389 | reject |

The speed signal is not enough to matter, and the sample-level parity failure
is large. A generator-only exact-geometry crop is therefore not a safe
production optimization. The current bucketed generator uses tail context from
the padded package before trimming; removing that context changes the emitted
prefix. If exact-duration packages are revisited, they need an end-to-end
exact graph and a listening/quality gate, not just a shorter HAR-post package
fed by cropped bucket tensors.

#### Generator split probes

`scripts/probe_generator_split.py`,
`scripts/probe_generator_noise_split.py`, and
`scripts/probe_generator_dual_anchor_split.py` test whether laishere-style
package boundaries help the current static HAR-post generator.
`scripts/probe_generator_stage_split.py` then splits the body by generator
upsample stage to locate the remaining bottleneck. The generated packages and
reports are ignored under `outputs/generator_split/`,
`outputs/generator_noise_split/`, `outputs/generator_dual_anchor_split/`, and
`outputs/generator_stage_split/`.

Local M2 Studio. Unless noted, values are N=10 medians after three discarded
warmups. The audio-anchor CPU+ANE and palettized CPU+ANE rows used N=3 after
one discarded warmup because they were already unambiguously slower than fused;
they are rejection probes only.

The final-tail split is too small to matter; the tail costs only about 1-2 ms.
The HAR-noise split is more informative: it proves the graph can be partitioned
with exact output parity and reduces the body package itself, but total latency
gets worse because the noise package plus extra dispatch cost outweighs the
body reduction. Forcing the noise-split body to CPU+ANE is catastrophic on this
local M2 Studio run.

The laishere architecture is therefore not "split off the tail" in a generic
sense. Its own README says tail split alone failed. The follow-up dual-output
probe now ports the visible scheduler ingredients that were still missing from
the earlier split tests: mean anchor output matching the public code, an
audio-anchor variant matching the README prose, fp32 tail, optional cos-form
Snake, and int8 palettization on the discarded-output vocoder. None of those
variants recreate a fast CPU+ANE path for the current static HAR-post graph,
and CPU+GPU remains slower than the fused package because extra package
dispatch plus noise/tail stages outweigh the smaller vocoder body. The next
viable performance work is therefore an operator-surface rewrite or a larger
end-to-end graph reshaping, not more generator package-boundary experiments.

The per-stage split proves there is no hidden ANE-friendly island inside the
current generator body. Explicit CPU+ANE makes every stage slower: noise grows
from `12.6 ms` to `67.0 ms`, stage0 grows from `9.0 ms` to `37.8 ms`, and
stage1+tail grows from `11.3 ms` to `93.1 ms` on the local M2 Studio `3s` dump.
The 3s MIL operation distribution is also broad, not a single isolated tail:
fused generator `2207` ops, noise `562`, stage0 `807`, stage1+tail `856`. The
next production candidate must remove work or change operator lowering within
all three generator regions; merely moving a substage to ANE is not supported
by the data.

The same 3s predict-only stage packages were copied to the two machines where
Config F still loses to laishere's chain-only short rows and run with
`--skip-export` against the same dumped tensors. CPU+GPU parity passed on both
hosts, and the stage distribution scales with each machine's known generator
cost:

| Machine | Placement | Pass | Fused median | Split median | Split stages | Parity vs fused |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| m2-air | CPU+GPU | yes | 120.5 ms | 126.6 ms | noise 51.2 ms, stage0 31.2 ms, stage1+tail 44.1 ms | corr 0.999997, SNR 52.83 dB |
| irvine-m1 | CPU+GPU | yes | 168.4 ms | 184.0 ms | noise 74.4 ms, stage0 44.9 ms, stage1+tail 64.6 ms | corr 0.999997, SNR 52.62 dB |
| m2-air | stage0 CPU+ANE | no | 120.0 ms | 123.7 ms | noise 50.8 ms, stage0 28.3 ms, stage1+tail 44.5 ms | corr 0.403806, SNR 0.47 dB |
| m2-air | stage1+tail CPU+ANE | no | 120.9 ms | 150.8 ms | noise 50.8 ms, stage0 31.0 ms, stage1+tail 69.3 ms | corr 0.120825, SNR 0.05 dB |
| irvine-m1 | stage0 CPU+ANE | no | 167.5 ms | 197.4 ms | noise 73.4 ms, stage0 58.7 ms, stage1+tail 65.8 ms | corr 0.403829, SNR 0.47 dB |
| irvine-m1 | stage1+tail CPU+ANE | no | 172.7 ms | 315.8 ms | noise 74.4 ms, stage0 44.7 ms, stage1+tail 196.2 ms | corr 0.121443, SNR 0.05 dB |

This closes the per-stage ANE fallback hypothesis on the losing machines too.
On M2 Air, stage0 CPU+ANE is superficially faster (`28.3 ms` vs `31.2 ms`) but
the audio output is invalid, so it is not a candidate. On Irvine M1, CPU+ANE is
both slower and invalid. The next speed work must target the CPU+GPU generator
operator count and memory movement directly.

#### Laishere stage profile

`scripts/external_bakeoff/profile_laishere_stages.py` profiles the pinned
`laishere/kokoro-coreml` seven-package chain with the same timing boundary as
the external bakeoff adapter: phonemization and feed preparation are reported
separately and excluded from the warm chain median. Results are ignored under
`outputs/external_bakeoff/placement/results_laishere_stage_profile_*.json`.

The profile keeps laishere's public compute-unit policy: Albert, post-Albert,
alignment, prosody, and vocoder use `CPU_AND_NE`; noise and tail use `ALL`.
Each value below is the N=5 median after three discarded warmups.

| Machine | Input | Total chain | Upstream stages | Noise+vocoder+tail | Noise | Vocoder | Tail |

The 3s/7s comparison against our generator-isolation measurements is useful,
but it is not a pure same-boundary comparison. Source audit of
`laishere/kokoro-coreml` shows `CoreMLVocoderDualOutput` includes
`F0_conv`, `N_conv`, `decoder.encode`, `decoder.decode`, and the generator
upsample/resblock body, then returns a discarded `anchor` plus `x_pre` for a
separate fp32 tail. Therefore laishere's `noise+vocoder+tail` is a
decoder-plus-generator body, while Config F's isolated generator starts after
`decoder_pre` at `x_pre + ref_s + har`.

| Machine | Input | Config F full | Config F generator | Laishere chain | Laishere noise+vocoder+tail | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| m2-studio | 3s | 60.2 ms | 27.2 ms | 104.5 ms | 90.4 ms | Config F wins decisively; laishere's split chain is slower here. |
| m2-studio | 7s | 110.5 ms | 59.5 ms | 192.7 ms | 168.0 ms | Config F wins decisively; no laishere generator advantage. |
| m2-air | 3s | 151.7 ms | 120.1 ms | 153.0 ms | 123.7 ms | Practical tie despite laishere's broader boundary. |
| m2-air | 7s | 335.0 ms | 277.6 ms | 334.7 ms | 279.0 ms | Practical tie; old laishere lead was measurement-scale, not a clear graph win. |
| irvine-m1 | 3s | 239.2 ms | 168.9 ms | 195.0 ms | 145.1 ms | Laishere wins; about half the gap is source/vocoder/tail and half upstream. |
| irvine-m1 | 7s | 510.2 ms | 384.7 ms | 444.2 ms | 340.4 ms | Laishere wins; the M1 gap is real, but the split boundary is broader than our isolated generator. |

This answers the "how is laishere/MLX faster?" question more narrowly. MLX is
not faster after warmed Config F correction. Laishere is not faster on M2 Studio
and is effectively tied on M2 Air when the stage-profile boundary is rerun. The
remaining real loss is Irvine M1 short/medium. That loss is not explained by a
simple Core ML compute-unit flip or by our already-tested split boundaries; the
graph-surface inspection below checks whether laishere's visible
`KokoroVocoder`/`KokoroNoise` operator choices explain it.
The next boundary-level probe should recreate laishere's actual
decoder-plus-generator body against the Swift dumps, not only the narrower
HAR-post `GeneratorFromHar` boundary.

#### Fused generator graph-surface probes

`scripts/probe_generator_cos_snake.py` tests generator operator rewrites that
can be applied without changing package boundaries. It exports a fused
`GeneratorFromHar` package, then compares the temporary package to the shipping
fused HAR-post package on the same Swift tensor dump. The patch hooks must
target `export_synth.wrappers.kokoro_istftnet`, because the exporter loads
Kokoro modules under dynamic names; patching `kokoro.istftnet` directly does
not affect the traced generator used by this repo's exporter.

`scripts/compare_coreml_graph_surface.py` records the MIL operation surface for
each package. The result file for the table below is ignored under
`outputs/graph_surface/laishere_vs_local_generator_3s.json`.

Local M2 Studio 3s, CPU+GPU, N=10 median after three discarded warmups:

| Probe | Spec | MIL ops | Key graph change | Fused median | Candidate median | Speedup vs fused | Parity vs fused | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |

| corrected broadcast AdaIN | 8 | 2015 | `tile` 96 -> 0 | 30.92 ms | 30.93 ms | -0.03% | corr 0.999997, SNR 53.17 dB | reject |
| native InstanceNorm AdaIN | 8 | 1731 | `reduce_mean` 88 -> 0, `instance_norm` 0 -> 44 | 31.00 ms | 30.93 ms | +0.24% | corr 0.999994, SNR 49.84 dB | reject |
| native InstanceNorm + broadcast + cos | 8 | 1635 | no `tile`, native `instance_norm`, cos Snake | 30.08 ms | 30.68 ms | -2.02% | corr 0.999994, SNR 49.71 dB | reject |
| native InstanceNorm + broadcast + cos + pal8 | 8 | 1635 | adds 101 `constexpr_lut_to_dense` ops; package `38M` -> `19M` | 29.64 ms | 31.31 ms | -5.65% | corr 0.999879, SNR 36.54 dB, max abs 0.01007 | reject; slower and misses max-abs gate |

The strongest visible graph cleanup is the combined native InstanceNorm +
broadcast + cos candidate: it drops the 3s fused graph from `2207` to `1635`
ops and removes explicit `tile`, explicit reduction-based normalization, and
nearly all Snake `sin` ops. That still does not improve local CPU+GPU runtime.
The same candidate was copied to the two lower-end Macs and run predict-only
against the existing 3s tensor dump:

| Machine | Fused median | Candidate median | Speedup vs fused | Parity vs fused | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| m2-air | 120.51 ms | 120.65 ms | -0.12% | corr 0.999994, SNR 49.96 dB | reject |
| irvine-m1 | 167.83 ms | 167.60 ms | +0.14% | corr 0.999994, SNR 50.00 dB | reject as noise-sized |

This closes the visible laishere graph-surface hypothesis for the current
fused generator boundary. We can reproduce its obvious source-level ingredients
inside our fused package, but they do not make Mac prediction faster. The
remaining M1 loss is therefore likely below the visible MIL histogram: Core ML
compute-plan/kernel selection, compiler/runtime/toolchain differences, or a
larger pipeline boundary difference rather than a simple AdaIN/Snake source
rewrite.

The palettized fused-generator row is the direct check against laishere's
`KokoroVocoder` metadata surface. `xcrun coremlcompiler metadata` reports
laishere's vocoder as mixed FP16/FP32 plus 8-bit palettized weights with
`101` `constexpr_lut_to_dense` ops; the local pal8 candidate reproduces that
LUT count and halves package size. It does not reproduce a speedup. The
candidate is slower and slightly fails the existing sample gate because its
palettized output is the final waveform. That differs from laishere's public
split: its palettized vocoder emits an intermediate audio anchor that is
discarded, while a separate tail emits the listener-facing waveform. Do not
ship or rank palettized fused-generator packages without a fresh quality gate.

Linear weight quantization is also rejected for the final-waveform generator.
`scripts/probe_generator_cos_snake.py --linear-quantize int8` compressed the
plain fixed-shape 3s candidate from `39.7 MB` to `20.2 MB` without changing the
visible MIL op histogram, but both macOS13 and iOS17 CPU+GPU runs crashed during
runtime specialization with `MPSGraphExecutable.mm:5070: failed assertion
'Error: MLIR pass manager failed'`. The saved package loads under CPU-only, but
the CPU-only row is not shippable: `93.27 ms` vs `97.43 ms` fused CPU-only and
fails parity (`corr 0.999051`, SNR `27.62 dB`, max abs `0.03387`). Compression
can reduce bundle size, but it is not the missing lower-end Mac speed path for
our final-waveform generator.

The toolchain-only hypothesis is also rejected for the current fused generator.
`scripts/probe_generator_cos_snake.py` now records `coremltools`, `torch`, and
`numpy` versions in its JSON reports, so the CT8/CT9 comparison is reproducible.
The CT9 package was generated with the same PyTorch 2.6 traced graph, same
iOS17 target, same fixed tensor shapes, and no source-level operator rewrites.
Its visible MIL surface is identical to the CT8 iOS17 package and shipping
package: `2207` ops, `51` conv, `4` conv_transpose, `88` reduce_mean, `96`
tile, `50` sin, and `1` cos.

| Host | Bucket | Shipping fused | CT8.3 iOS17 plain | CT9.0 iOS17 plain | Decision |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| m2-studio | 3s | 30.07 ms | 29.76 ms | 29.81 ms | tie; same-process N=30 |
| m2-studio | 7s | 59.87 ms | not rerun | 60.49 ms | reject |
| m2-air | 3s | 120.803 ms | not rerun | 120.816 ms | tie; remote N=30 |
| irvine-m1 | 3s | 167.900 ms | not rerun | 167.947 ms | tie; remote N=30 |

The initial CT9 3s export run looked modestly faster than fused (`29.74 ms` vs
`30.39 ms`), but an alternating same-process timing pass showed CT8 iOS17,
CT9 iOS17, and shipping fused within run noise. On M2 Air and Irvine M1, CT9
was effectively identical to shipping fused. Therefore a coremltools 9
conversion alone is not the reason laishere retains an M1 short-bucket lead.

The flexible-shape hypothesis is rejected for the current fused generator
boundary. Laishere's `KokoroVocoder` advertises bounded flexible input ranges,
so `scripts/probe_generator_cos_snake.py` now has `--input-shape-mode range`.
That mode marks `x_pre` as `1 x 512 x 1...2000` and `har` as
`1 x 22 x 1...240001`, with the current dump dimensions as defaults. This
successfully produces packages with `hasShapeFlexibility=1`, but prediction is
not usable:

| Probe | Toolchain | MIL ops | Fused median | Candidate median | Parity vs fused | Runtime signal | Decision |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| plain RangeDim | CT8.3 / torch 2.6 | 3135 | 49.73 ms | 1561.07 ms | corr 0.999136, SNR 27.77 dB, max abs 0.03076 | `tile` shape-propagation failure | reject |
| native+broadcast+cos RangeDim | CT8.3 / torch 2.6 | 1659 | 31.91 ms | 343.61 ms | corr 0.999135, SNR 27.76 dB, max abs 0.02783 | dynamic `add` broadcast failure | reject |
| native+broadcast+cos RangeDim | CT9.0 / torch 2.6 | 1659 | 33.05 ms | 343.96 ms | corr 0.999135, SNR 27.76 dB, max abs 0.02783 | dynamic `add` broadcast failure | reject |

The plain range package keeps explicit `tile`, and E5RT reports
`All values of reps must be at least 1` during shape propagation. The
tile-free native+broadcast graph removes that failure, but E5RT then reports
`Shapes are not compatible for broadcasting` on dynamic `add`. CT9 does not
change that outcome. Coremltools also refuses explicit output shapes for
conversion outputs, so the dynamic output metadata cannot be fixed by simply
declaring the traced waveform shape. This strongly suggests laishere's flexible
inputs only work because its package boundary exposes different intermediate
tensors and avoids the fused generator's dynamic broadcast surface; RangeDim is
not a production path for our current final-waveform fused package.

#### Style-specialized generator probe

`scripts/probe_generator_style_specialization.py` tests a more aggressive
voice-specialized graph: it bakes the `ref_s` vector from the tensor dump into
the generator and replaces each `AdaIN1d` with fixed gamma/beta constants. The
temporary package takes only `x_pre` and `har`, so it removes the per-inference
style projection path. This is a benchmark/prototype tradeoff, not a drop-in
production exporter, because it would require separate generator packages per
voice/style.

The graph does shrink materially. On the local 3s package, MIL ops dropped from
`2207` to `1625`, removing all `linear`, `reshape`, `split`, and `tile` ops
from the style path. Package size moved the wrong way, though: the specialized
3s package is `315 MB` and the 7s package is `690 MB`, because the constants
are baked into the package artifact.

| Machine | Input | Fused median | Style-specialized median | Speedup vs fused | Parity vs fused | Decision |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| m2-studio | 3s | 31.3 ms | 31.9 ms | -1.98% | corr 0.999994, SNR 49.36 dB | reject |
| m2-studio | 7s | 63.9 ms | 64.2 ms | -0.50% | corr 0.999995, SNR 50.65 dB | reject |
| m2-air | 3s | 120.8 ms | 123.0 ms | -1.82% | corr 0.999994, SNR 49.73 dB | reject |
| irvine-m1 | 3s | 167.8 ms | 170.8 ms | -1.79% | corr 0.999994, SNR 49.68 dB | reject |

The result is important: deleting style-projection ops and tile ops from the
MIL graph did not make prediction faster on any tested Mac, including the two
machines where Config F still trails laishere's chain-only short rows. Core ML
was apparently already handling the dynamic style path efficiently enough that
constant-folding it is not a speed path. Do not pursue per-voice generator
packages for performance without a new compiler/runtime reason.

#### Laishere-style decoder+vocoder boundary probe

`scripts/probe_decoder_vocoder_split.py` tests the broader boundary found in
`laishere/kokoro-coreml`: a separate HAR-noise package, a dual-output body that
includes decoder F0/N conv, decoder encode/decode, and the generator body, then
a separate fp32 tail. The baseline is the same Swift tensor dump run through the
checked-in `decoder_pre` package plus the checked-in fused HAR-post generator.

Cross-machine `3s` results:

| Candidate body units | Baseline median | Candidate median | Stage medians | Parity vs fused | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| m2-studio CPU+ANE | 32.9 ms | 119.5 ms | noise 12.0 ms, body 105.6 ms, tail 1.5 ms | corr 0.999917, SNR 38.19 dB | reject; ANE compiler failure emitted |
| m2-studio CPU+GPU | 33.2 ms | 38.0 ms | noise 11.9 ms, body 24.7 ms, tail 1.4 ms | corr 0.999991, SNR 47.76 dB | reject |
| m2-air CPU+ANE | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | reject; stopped after more than 110s in `ANECompilerService` |
| m2-air CPU+GPU | 123.7 ms | 138.8 ms | noise 52.2 ms, body 84.4 ms, tail 2.1 ms | corr 0.999991, SNR 47.70 dB | reject |
| irvine-m1 CPU+ANE | 176.3 ms | 314.6 ms | noise 75.2 ms, body 235.5 ms, tail 3.9 ms | corr 0.999907, SNR 37.69 dB | reject |
| irvine-m1 CPU+GPU | 174.6 ms | 199.3 ms | noise 74.9 ms, body 119.8 ms, tail 4.8 ms | corr 0.999991, SNR 47.72 dB | reject |

This closes the direct "copy laishere's decoder+vocoder split boundary" path for
our current Swift dump contract on every tested Mac. The remaining laishere
advantage on Irvine M1 short/medium rows is not explained by this boundary
alone. It must come from laishere's full runtime/package details, a
hardware-specific Core ML compile plan, or work reduction outside the reproduced
boundary.

#### F0-noise exact-shape reuse probe

A one-off package-reuse probe fed the Swift tensor dumps into the pinned
laishere `KokoroNoise`/`KokoroVocoder`/`KokoroTail` packages. This is not a
drop-in implementation because it uses laishere's F0-driven noise source rather
than our Swift HnSF/HAR tensor and the waveform is not numerically close to the
current output. It is still useful because it tests the likely missing speed
ingredient: delete the large HAR input and run exact dynamic `asr`/`F0` lengths.

The shape effect is large. On local M2 Studio, feeding padded 3s tensors
(`asr=120`, `F0=240`) made laishere's vocoder take `237.2 ms`; feeding natural
`asr=112` dropped the vocoder to `58-64 ms`. On Irvine M1, padded 3s tensors
took `245.1 ms` total for noise+vocoder+tail, while natural `asr=112` with
`F0=240` took `135.4 ms`.

Irvine M1 direct package-reuse timings:

| Input | Shape | Noise+vocoder+tail | Current DecoderPre+HnSF+Generator stack | Estimated full Config F if substituted | Parity vs current dump | Decision |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 3s | `asr=112`, `F0=240` | 135.4 ms | 199.3 ms | ~175.3 ms | corr 0.699830, SNR 0.56 dB | promising speed, not quality-safe |
| 7s | `asr=270`, `F0=540` | 337.4 ms | 443.1 ms | ~404.5 ms | corr 0.701953, SNR 0.64 dB | promising speed, still trails laishere unless upstream also improves |

The speed implication is concrete: replacing the M1 3s
`DecoderPre + Swift HnSF + GeneratorFromHar` stack with an exact-shape
F0-noise/vocoder/tail stack could put Config F roughly at the laishere 3s row.
The quality implication is equally concrete: current correlation/SNR is far too
low for a parity claim. The next optimization target should be a first-party
F0-noise exact-shape probe with listening review and quality recovery, not more
HAR-post repartitioning.

#### First-party F0-noise exact-shape probe

`scripts/probe_f0_noise_exact_shape.py` exports the F0-noise path from our own
weights instead of reusing laishere packages. It keeps the checked-in
`decoder_pre + GeneratorFromHar` packages as the baseline and compares them
against first-party `F0_curve + style_timbre -> x_source_*`, decoder+generator
body, and fp32 tail packages. The probe also records a PyTorch candidate
reference so conversion drift can be separated from inherent path drift.

The source-shape reduction is real: local `3s` natural-ASR export produces
`x_source_0=[1,256,2240]` and `x_source_1=[1,128,13441]`, compared with the
HAR-noise split's `x_source_0=[1,256,4800]` and `x_source_1=[1,128,28801]`.
At `7s`, the natural-ASR export uses `x_source_0=[1,256,5400]` and
`x_source_1=[1,128,32401]`; padded uses `x_source_0=[1,256,5600]` and
`x_source_1=[1,128,33601]`.

This is a useful narrowing result. The first-party candidate reproduces the M1
and `7s` speed opportunity without relying on external packages, but the PyTorch
candidate itself diverges from the current HAR output. The `10s`, `15s`, and
`30s` buckets keep the same pattern and complete the runtime bucket sweep:
the F0-source path is faster, especially at natural shape, and the speedup grows
with duration on local M2 Studio. The local PyTorch reference is already too far
from the current dump, so the quality failure is inherent to the F0-noise/source
formulation being tested, not a Core ML conversion bug. A shippable optimization
must either make the F0-noise path match the current Swift HnSF/HAR source
closely enough, or prove through listening review that the different source is
acceptable. Until then, this is a research target rather than a production
replacement.

#### F0-source listening pack

`scripts/create_f0_source_listening_pack.py` turns saved
`probe_f0_noise_exact_shape.py` reports into reviewable WAV artifacts without
re-exporting packages and without ASR/Whisper. It renders the Swift dump
reference, checked-in baseline Core ML path, and F0-source candidate on the same
tensor dump, then runs the repo's objective waveform-health gate and writes a
fillable listening review.

Local generated pack:

```bash

Interpretation: strict tensor parity still rejects both candidates, but the
machine audio-health gate does not reject them as silence, clipping, or broken
spectral content. The `7s` data keeps the speed-positive signal on both local
M2 Studio and Irvine M1, and the `10s` data shows the same speed-positive,
quality-negative pattern in the newly added runtime bucket. The `15s` and `30s`
local probes complete the `3s`/`7s`/`10s`/`15s`/`30s` runtime bucket sweep and
strengthen the trend: speedup grows with duration, while the same source quality
gap remains. The padded source improves objective similarity while preserving
some of that speed. The exact-shape F0-source path is now a human-listening
question, not an automatic machine reject. It is still not production-approved
until listening decisions accept the different source character or a
quality-preserving source formulation closes the metric gap.

#### F0/HAR source variant probes

`scripts/probe_f0_source_variants.py` compares cheap PyTorch source/STFT
variants against dumped Swift `har_source` and `har_padded` tensors before any
Core ML export. The downsample approximation is not the quality culprit:
`avg_pool` and linear interpolation are effectively tied at the source boundary
(`3s` corr `0.93978`, `7s` corr `0.96731`). Recomputing STFT from the exact
dumped Swift source gives exact magnitude but phase differs at the `+-pi`
representation boundary; modulo `2*pi`, the phase error is tiny. Later
debug-graph bisection supersedes the early waveform sensitivity check: once the
same fused source graph is traced and inspected with intermediate outputs, the
PyTorch `har_source -> waveform` path itself is only `3s` corr `0.987820` versus
the Swift dump. So the compact source boundary has a real source/STFT convention
gap even before Core ML scheduling enters.

`scripts/probe_har_source_noise_split.py` exports a temporary
`har_source + style -> x_source_*` package, then reuses the decoder-vocoder
body/tail split. This tests a compact exact-source boundary without changing
shipping packages.

`scripts/probe_har_source_fused.py` tests the same compact exact-source
boundary but keeps STFT, generator body, and iSTFT tail fused into one Core ML
graph. This avoids the body/tail split drift, and is the better speed shape, but
it still fails parity.

`scripts/probe_coreml_stft_semantics.py` isolates the converted forward-STFT
subgraph. It proves one concrete conversion bug: Core ML preserves the STFT
`real`, `imag`, and `magnitude` tensors, but converted
`torch.atan2(imag, real)` phase is wrong even with `compute_units=cpu_only`.
`scripts/probe_har_source_fused_debug.py` then moves the bisection forward: with
fp32 manual-atan phase, Core ML matches PyTorch through `har`, `x_source_*`,
`pre_tail`, and `waveform`, but that PyTorch path still fails parity against the
Swift dump.

| fused `har_source`, 7s fp16 | 60.9 ms | 51.2 ms | corr 0.979271, SNR 13.06 dB | speed-positive, blocked on Core ML parity |

Interpretation: exact dumped source improves quality over the F0-source path,
but the Core ML/STFT source-boundary path still fails strict parity. The staged
source split has too little speed margin once Swift source generation is
counted. The fused source graph has enough package-level speed upside to remain
a research target, but two separate blockers are now proven: native Core ML
`atan2` conversion is broken, and even a Core ML-correct fp32 manual phase graph
does not reproduce the current Swift HAR waveform closely enough.

The STFT-only semantic probe gives the exact bisection:

| STFT subgraph, 3s fp16 CPU-only | Core ML vs reference | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `real` | corr 1.000000, SNR 63.33 dB | good |
| `imag` | corr 1.000000, SNR 62.97 dB | good |
| `magnitude` | corr 1.000000, SNR 63.74 dB | good |
| `atan2` phase | corr 0.818405 vs PyTorch, SNR 4.67 dB | broken conversion |
| `acos` phase | wrapped mean abs 0.01285 rad | better modulo wrap, raw parity still bad |
| `atan_manual` phase fp16 | wrapped mean abs 0.00369 rad | better modulo wrap, raw parity still bad |
| `atan_manual` phase fp32 | corr 1.000000 vs PyTorch, SNR 152.00 dB | Core ML-safe replacement for `atan2` |

The fused-debug probe then shows where the remaining error lives:

| Fused debug, 3s `atan_manual` fp32 CPU-only | Core ML vs PyTorch | PyTorch/Core ML vs Swift dump |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `har` | corr 1.000000, SNR 152.03 dB | not the remaining Core ML drift |
| `x_source_0` | corr 1.000000, SNR 87.04 dB | not the remaining Core ML drift |
| `x_source_1` | corr 1.000000, SNR 79.55 dB | not the remaining Core ML drift |
| `pre_tail` | corr 1.000000, SNR 86.21 dB | not the remaining Core ML drift |
| `waveform` | corr 1.000000, SNR 72.24 dB | PyTorch/Core ML both corr 0.987820 vs Swift dump |

Observed failure mode: converted `atan2` is quadrant-unsafe. For example, when
`imag == 0` and `real < 0`, the Core ML phase can be `0` instead of `pi`. Manual
`atan` in fp32 fixes that conversion bug. However, waveform parity remains below
threshold because the compact source-boundary graph is not the same numerical
contract as the current Swift HAR dump.

Two contract details now matter:

- The shipping `GeneratorFromHar` graph was traced against bucket-padded HAR
  (`3s` input `[1,22,28801]`). Feeding the fused source graph's natural STFT
  length (`3s` `[1,22,14401]`) changes the downstream noise-conv contract.
  Padding the recomputed HAR back to `28801` restores most quality but removes
  the speed edge and still misses strict parity.
- The raw `+pi/-pi` branch mismatch is isolated to phase channel `10`
  (Nyquist). Channels `0-9` match Swift essentially exactly. Replacing only the
  Nyquist phase with the dumped Swift channel restores PyTorch waveform parity
  to corr `0.999991`, SNR `47.76 dB`; setting it to `0`, `+pi`, or `-pi` is
  worse. A production fused-source path therefore needs either the exact Swift
  Nyquist convention in Core ML or a representation that removes raw Nyquist
  phase as a learned feature.
- Rebuilding the DFT basis with Swift-like `Float` trigonometry is not the
  explanation. A Python scalar reproduction using float32 `2*pi*k*n/N`,
  float32 Hann values, and float32 frame dot products keeps magnitude exact
  (SNR `124.76 dB`) but makes Nyquist phase worse (`2871` raw `2*pi` branch
  errors, channel-10 corr `0.139881`). The problem is the raw Nyquist branch
  convention itself, not simply NumPy-double versus Swift-float basis constants.

`scripts/probe_nyquist_phase_contribution.py` closes the tempting
"neutralize/fold Nyquist phase" shortcut. The learned `noise_convs` do not put
large raw weight mass on HAR channel `21` (Nyquist phase): conv0 uses about
`0.71%` of absolute weight mass / `2.10%` of L2 mass, and conv1 uses about
`0.70%` of absolute mass / `3.29%` of L2 mass. But the feature is still
quality-sensitive because it is a time-varying learned input before residual
conditioning.

The probe also separates two effects that were easy to conflate:

- At the compact natural HAR length, even exact dumped HAR is only about `3s`
  corr `0.988453` / SNR `16.74 dB` and `7s` corr `0.985991` / SNR `16.01 dB`
  against the Swift waveform. That confirms a natural-vs-padded generator
  geometry loss independent of Nyquist branch choice.
- At the padded shipping HAR length, dumped HAR recovers parity (`3s` corr
  `0.9999909`, SNR `47.76 dB`; `7s` corr `0.9999955`, SNR `50.78 dB`), and
  replacing only recomputed Nyquist with the dumped channel recovers essentially
  the same result (`3s` corr `0.9999909`; `7s` corr `0.9999933`). But deployable
  substitutes fail: zero Nyquist is only `3s` corr `0.998239` / SNR `24.82 dB`
  and `7s` corr `0.998804` / SNR `26.43 dB`; mean Nyquist is `3s` corr
  `0.998349` / SNR `25.25 dB` and `7s` corr `0.998915` / SNR `27.17 dB`;
  constant `+pi`/`-pi` is worse.

Decision: reject neutralizing, mean-folding, or constant-folding raw Nyquist
phase as a production path. The fused-source speed path still needs either an
exactly reproduced Swift Nyquist convention or a representation/model boundary
that was trained or transformed to avoid raw phase discontinuities.

#### Generator compute-unit ladder

Swift generator-input isolation on local M2 Studio 3s confirms the current
staged production placement is the right policy for this graph. Command shape:

```bash
swift/.build/release/kokoro-bench \
  --models-dir coreml \
  --inputs-dir outputs/swift_bench_inputs \
  --hnsf-weights outputs/swift_bench_inputs/hnsf_weights.json \
  --generator-input-dump outputs/generator_isolation/dumps/3s \
  --compute-units cpuAndGPU \
  --warmup 5 --iterations 20 \
  --output outputs/generator_isolation/compute_units_3s_cpugpu.json
```

| Generator 3s compute units | Warm median predict |
| --- | ---: |
| `.all` | `28.071 ms` |
| `cpuAndGPU` | `28.289 ms` |
| `cpuOnly` | `99.673 ms` |
| `cpuAndNeuralEngine` | `1517.266 ms` |

The CPU+NE run printed
`MILCompilerForANE error: failed to compile ANE model using ANEF`, then fell
back to a very slow path. This rejects "just use ANE for the generator" as the
M2 Air / Irvine M1 short-bucket fix. The remaining generator gap is a graph
shape/export problem.

#### Current laishere stage comparison

The latest local stage comparison narrows what remains to beat on lower-end
Macs. Against the corrected Config F HAR-direct-pad path:

| Machine | Input | Config F wall | Config F generator | laishere total | laishere noise | laishere vocoder | laishere tail |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| m2-studio | 3s | 60.2 ms | 28.8 ms | 104.5 ms | 26.2 ms | 60.9 ms | 3.2 ms |
| m2-studio | 7s | 110.5 ms | 58.3 ms | 192.7 ms | 37.6 ms | 125.7 ms | 4.8 ms |
| m2-air | 3s | 151.7 ms | 120.6 ms | 153.0 ms | 46.1 ms | 73.8 ms | 3.8 ms |
| m2-air | 7s | 335.0 ms | 277.6 ms | 334.7 ms | 92.4 ms | 175.9 ms | 10.7 ms |
| irvine-m1 | 3s | 239.2 ms | 167.6 ms | 195.0 ms | 57.9 ms | 82.8 ms | 4.4 ms |
| irvine-m1 | 7s | 510.2 ms | 387.6 ms | 444.2 ms | 114.1 ms | 216.5 ms | 9.8 ms |

Interpretation: M2 Air is no longer a clear laishere loss once the corrected
same-boundary stage profile is used; it is effectively tied at 3s/7s. Irvine M1
still loses, and the loss is concentrated in the combined source/vocoder region:
Config F HnSF+generator is `194.9 ms` at 3s and `434.7 ms` at 7s, versus
laishere noise+vocoder+tail at `145.1 ms` and `340.4 ms`. Future lower-end Mac
work should target that combined source/vocoder contract, not duration, F0,
decoder-pre, compute-unit policy, or generic compression.

#### Fused HnSF merge probe

Rejected path: fusing the HnSF 9-to-1 linear merge into the harmonic loop
slightly reduced the isolated HnSF stage in some local runs, but it did not
improve warm full-pipeline inference. The probe kept the seeded Swift source
contract, pre-generated the same Gaussian-noise layout, and accumulated each
weighted harmonic directly into the merged source instead of materializing the
`9 * L` sine/noise matrix for `vDSP_mmul`. The experimental runtime flag was
removed after measurement to avoid carrying dead complexity.

Local M2 Ultra, exact duration packages, staged compute units, N=10 warm median
after three discarded preflight calls:

| Input | Baseline wall | Fused wall | Wall delta | Baseline HnSF | Fused HnSF | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 3s | 56.42 ms | 60.16 ms | -3.74 ms | 10.86 ms | 9.65 ms | reject; wall slower |
| 7s | 107.69 ms | 108.60 ms | -0.91 ms | 24.93 ms | 23.09 ms | reject; wall neutral/slower |

Irvine M1, paired padded-duration artifact set available on that host, staged
compute units, N=10 warm median after three discarded preflight calls:

| Input | Baseline wall | Fused wall | Wall delta | Baseline HnSF | Fused HnSF | Baseline generator | Fused generator | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 3s | 295.94 ms | 299.34 ms | -3.40 ms | 11.24 ms | 10.72 ms | 166.59 ms | 166.27 ms | reject; wall slower |
| 7s | 642.97 ms | 640.37 ms | +2.61 ms | 25.96 ms | 26.16 ms | 383.50 ms | 383.07 ms | reject; tiny, noisy wall win |

The padded-duration M1 probe used a temporary checkout where `coreml` was a
symlink. Swift `FileManager.contentsOfDirectory(at:)` did not enumerate exact
duration packages through that symlink, even though direct package paths
resolved. The discovery path now resolves the models directory symlink before
enumeration; the fix was verified on Irvine with `--models-dir coreml`, where
the benchmark discovered exact packages and selected `exact_t44`. A rerun with
an absolute `--models-dir` selected `exact_t44` and `exact_t105` correctly:

| Input | Exact-duration wall | Duration model | HnSF | Generator | Duration | F0Ntrain | DecoderPre |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3s | 238.99 ms | exact_t44 | 19.12 ms | 166.02 ms | 23.07 ms | 10.21 ms | 3.17 ms |
| 7s | 504.08 ms | exact_t105 | 27.76 ms | 383.08 ms | 40.64 ms | 11.57 ms | 5.72 ms |

Conclusion: after the vDSP HnSF work, exact Swift HnSF is not large enough to
close the lower-end Mac gap. On Irvine M1 with the exact-duration baseline,
generator predict remains roughly `166 ms` for 3s and `383 ms` for 7s, while
HnSF is `19 ms` and `28 ms`. The next quality-safe speed work should attack the
generator/vocoder graph boundary, not further Swift source micro-optimizations.

#### HAR input-trim probe

`scripts/probe_generator_har_input_trim.py` tests a lower-risk variant of the
exact-shape idea: keep the bucketed `x_pre` shape and current Swift HAR source,
but export `GeneratorFromHar` with a shorter static `har` axis than the shipping
`3s` package's `[1,22,28801]` input. This checks whether the zero-padded HAR tail
can be removed without changing the source formulation.

PyTorch sweep result: trimming to `har_time=27601` crosses `35 dB` SNR but still
has a `0.027` max absolute waveform delta versus the full-HAR baseline.
`har_time=28561` is the first strict local point with max error below `0.01`
(`corr 0.999993`, SNR `49.25 dB`, max `0.00519` in PyTorch), but it only removes
240 of 28,801 HAR frames.

Core ML predict results:

| Machine | HAR time | Baseline median | Candidate median | Speedup | Parity vs baseline | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| m2-studio | 27601 | 30.22 ms | 29.90 ms | +1.07% | corr 0.999827, SNR 35.05 dB, max 0.02661 | reject; strict parity fail |
| m2-studio | 28561 | 30.07 ms | 30.41 ms | -1.15% | corr 0.999983, SNR 45.13 dB, max 0.00737 | reject; quality-safe but slower |
| irvine-m1 | 28561 | 168.36 ms | 167.64 ms | +0.43% | corr 0.999984, SNR 45.28 dB, max 0.00684 | reject; too small to close laishere gap |

This closes the "just trim the HAR tail" path. It can recover less than one
millisecond on M1 at strict parity, while the remaining laishere 3s gap is about
`63 ms` at full-pipeline Config F and about `24 ms` at the generator-equivalent
boundary. The speed target still requires a real source/vocoder formulation
change, not a slightly shorter padded HAR input.

#### HnSF vDSP optimization

Current `main` vectorizes the Swift HnSF STFT path with cached 20-point DFT
basis rows and `vDSP_desamp`, and vectorizes the harmonic 9-to-1 merge with
`vDSP_mmul` + vForce `tanh`. This keeps the HnSF boundary in Swift/Accelerate
but moves the hot sliding-dot-product loops out of scalar Swift.

Measured HnSF stage speedup versus the earlier staged + exact run:

| Machine | 3s | 7s | 10s | 15s | 30s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| m2-studio | 1.32x | 1.29x | 1.30x | 1.24x | 1.37x |
| m2-air | 1.32x | 1.33x | 1.33x | 1.36x | 1.31x |
| irvine-m1 | 1.37x | 1.23x | 1.29x | 1.27x | 1.31x |

Measured total wall-clock speedup versus the earlier staged + exact run for
the isolated vDSP change:

| Machine | 3s | 7s | 10s | 15s | 30s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| m2-studio | 1.11x | 1.08x | 1.04x | 1.06x | 1.09x |
| m2-air | 1.05x | 1.42x | 1.02x | 1.02x | 1.06x |
| irvine-m1 | 1.05x | 1.05x | 1.02x | 1.02x | 1.02x |

The local M2 Studio spot-check WAVs from the vDSP run passed the lightweight
waveform-health probe against the previous staged + exact Config F outputs:
duration, RMS, active fraction, zero-crossing rate, voiced-band energy, clipping,
sample rate, and channel count stayed within the probe thresholds. This is a
sanity check, not a new human-listening decision.

### Hardware Placement Evidence

This bakeoff records framework and compute-unit evidence. Local privileged
`powermetrics` captures were added after the primary latency collection for
Config F, MLX, Soniqo, and laishere placement context:

- Config F's corrected paper-facing rows run the Swift `kokoro-bench` path over
  Core ML packages with `--compute-units staged` and exact duration model
  discovery. The result records include per-stage Core ML timings for Duration,
  F0Ntrain, DecoderPre, generator, and Swift HnSF calls.
- Local M2 Studio placement check: `powermetrics -i 500 -n 80 --samplers
  cpu_power,gpu_power,ane_power` ran while a debug `kokoro-bench` process
  executed a post-prime 3s Config F loop with five discarded preflight calls and
  forty recorded warm calls. The recorded JSON is ignored at
  `outputs/external_bakeoff/placement/results_config_f_reference_m2-studio_3s_warm_placement.json`.
  The median warm call was `1.075376s` on a 2.8s output; this number is not used
  in the paper table because it came from a debug binary and padded duration
  artifacts. The placement signal was CPU/GPU-dominant: `ANE Power` had 80
  samples with min/median/max `0/0/0 mW`, while `GPU HW active residency` had 80
  samples with min/median/max `52.56/68.835/99.17%`. The last recorded call
  spent `0.082838s` in Duration Core ML, `0.004875s` in F0Ntrain Core ML,
  `0.004963s` in DecoderPre Core ML, `0.034667s` in generator Core ML, and
  `0.915704s` in Swift HnSF.
- MLX ran through the `mlx-audio` Python package and MLX model
  `mlx-community/Kokoro-82M-bf16`; prior host setup recorded MLX default device
  as `gpu` on M2 Air, and MLX routes array kernels through Metal on Apple
  Silicon.
- Local M2 Studio MLX placement check: the pinned `mlx-audio 0.4.3` adapter ran
  a 7s input with thirty recorded warm calls while `powermetrics` sampled every
  500 ms with `cpu_power,gpu_power,ane_power`. The recorded JSON is ignored at
  `outputs/external_bakeoff/placement/results_mlx_audio_m2-studio_7s_warm_placement.json`.
  Median warm time was `0.2207245s` for a 6.75s output. The placement signal was
  MLX/Metal as expected: `ANE Power` had 114 samples with min/median/max
  `0/0/0 mW`, while `GPU HW active residency` had 114 samples with
  min/median/max `32.6/49.435/98.28%`.
- Soniqo ran Swift `KokoroTTSModel.fromPretrained(computeUnits: .all)` and
  loaded Core ML through `MLModel` via the public `speech-swift` KokoroTTS
  surface.
- Local M2 Studio Soniqo placement check: the generated Swift CLI rebuilt from
  the pinned `speech-swift` checkout at
  `0d09a2ed5464c7c94cf4545be59043c21f8775ea`, ran `computeUnits: .all`, and
  synthesized the 3s input with thirty recorded warm calls while `powermetrics`
  sampled every 500 ms with `cpu_power,gpu_power,ane_power`. The recorded JSON
  is ignored at
  `outputs/external_bakeoff/placement/results_soniqo_m2-studio_3s_warm_placement.json`.
  Median warm time was `0.0690795s` for a 2.7s output. `ANE Power` had 120
  samples with min/median/max `0/0/0 mW`, while `GPU HW active residency` had
  120 samples with min/median/max `31.55/50.465/98.15%`.
- laishere ran seven `.mlpackage` Core ML models converted from its public repo.
  Its timed boundary is the Core ML chain only.
- Local M2 Studio laishere placement check: the pinned
  `laishere/kokoro-coreml` checkout at
  `484907db6a8347a6afb6e7b86850ea2878c6a3fb` was reconverted under a disposable
  Python venv. Conversion produced all seven `.mlpackage` files but its own
  end-to-end validation failed in `KokoroPostAlbert` with a Core ML
  dynamic-shape BNNS/Espresso error under this newer local stack. The generated
  packages still ran through the bakeoff adapter on the 3s input, so a placement
  trace was captured with thirty recorded warm calls while `powermetrics`
  sampled every 500 ms. The recorded JSON is ignored at
  `outputs/external_bakeoff/placement/results_laishere_m2-studio_3s_warm_placement.json`.
  Median warm time was `0.091534s` for a 2.775s output. `ANE Power` had 97
  samples with min/median/max `0/0/0 mW`, while `GPU HW active residency` had 97
  samples with min/median/max `38.54/54.23/94.25%`.

The historical Config F placement capture is not ANE-residency proof for the
corrected paper thesis. It is the opposite for that captured local debug path:
Core ML was allowed to use all compute units, but the measured M2 Studio loop
showed no ANE power draw and substantial GPU activity. That matches the
existing compute-unit ablation note: the staged runtime keeps the ANE-eligible
decoder-pre island separate and deliberately keeps the ANE-hostile generator on
CPU/GPU. The MLX capture is useful GPU evidence for the primary MLX competitor.
The Soniqo capture proves the primary iOS/Core ML comparator was also not
ANE-resident on this M2 Studio run despite `.all`. The laishere backup trace
likewise showed no ANE power on this local M2 Studio 3s run, with the
conversion-validation caveat above.

### Quality Caveats

Every successful cell wrote a mono 24 kHz spot-check WAV and passed the
lightweight waveform sanity gate: duration, RMS, active fraction,
zero-crossing rate, speech-band energy, clipping, sample rate, and channel
count. Human listening is recorded in
`outputs/external_bakeoff/listening/external_bakeoff_listening_decisions.csv`;
the operator listened to all successful rows and marked all 57 successful audio
rows `pass` because the audio was valid. The reproducible listening checklist
can be generated with
`python scripts/external_bakeoff/create_listening_review.py`; it writes
Markdown, local HTML, and a fillable
`external_bakeoff_listening_decisions.csv` under
`outputs/external_bakeoff/listening/` using only the collected Kokoro TTS WAVs.
The CSV intentionally leaves `human_decision` blank until the operator listens;
regeneration preserves existing decisions by default.
After filling the CSV, run
`python scripts/external_bakeoff/validate_listening_decisions.py`; it must pass
before any latency cell is interpreted as quality parity.
The overall plan-completion check is
`python scripts/external_bakeoff/verify_external_bakeoff_completion.py`; it
passes with `result_record_count=65`, `ios_preflight_ok=true`, and
`decisions={'pass': 57}`.

Known caveats:

- **MLX 3s:** every machine failed the shared 3s input with
  `ValueError: [broadcast_shapes] Shapes (1,67200,1) and (1,67500,9) cannot be broadcast.`
  This is recorded as public-implementation behavior for the current pinned
  clone and manifest text.
- **Soniqo long buckets:** the public Soniqo Kokoro artifact emits 5.0s audio
  for the 7s, 10s, 15s, and 30s inputs because the upstream public Core ML repo
  only publishes `kokoro_5s.mlmodelc`. These cells are implementation behavior,
  not long-bucket quality-parity evidence.
- **laishere boundary:** laishere is the long-bucket Core ML backup, but its
  numbers exclude G2P and feed preparation.

### Interpretation

The corrected Mac data supports the narrower and stronger claim that Config F's
staged + exact-duration Swift/Core ML path is faster than the pinned MLX
implementation on every MLX-comparable warmed inference cell. MLX still fails
the shared `3s` input, so there is no valid MLX `3s` comparison.

The broad claim that Config F is the absolute fastest way to run Kokoro on
every Apple device is not proven yet. laishere's Core ML chain remains faster on
M2 Air `3s`/`7s`/`10s`/`15s` and M1 `3s`/`7s`/`10s`/`15s`, although it is not
an equivalent end-to-end TTS boundary because G2P and feed preparation are
excluded. Config F now beats laishere on every M2 Studio bucket, M2 Air `30s`,
and M1 `30s`. Soniqo is a useful iOS/Core ML comparator, but its public artifact
emits 5s audio for the long buckets, so its long-bucket latency cannot prove
full-duration parity. The connected iPhone currently has Soniqo-on-device
results only; Config F has not yet been ported and benchmarked on that iPhone.

The next optimization target is clear: make the generator stage faster on M2 Air
and M1, then rerun against laishere's chain-only boundary and an on-device
iPhone Config F runner. HnSF is now materially faster and the redundant
generator-input copies are gone, but generator prediction still dominates M2 Air
and M1 wall time. Until that is done, the defensible paper claim is: faster than
the pinned MLX implementation on warmed Mac inference, with remaining work to
prove absolute fastest across every device and every comparator boundary.

## Method

- Forced the synthesis path to `decoder_har_post_bucket_impl` only
- Swapped only the HAR-post Core ML packages between local repo and HF download
- Used identical text, voice, speed, and pipeline code on both sides
- `torch.manual_seed(0)` before each timed call
- Measured:
  - **cold call:** first `synthesize()` after pipeline construction

## Bakeoff v11: mask-aware bucketing branch, Config F stages on M3 Max

### Summary

The `mask-aware-bucketing` branch replaces the duration model's unrolled BiLSTM with two stock `lstm` ops and masks bucket padding out of every time-axis statistic. Measured with `kokoro-bench --batch` under the production compute policy (duration and f0ntrain on `cpuAndGPU`, decoder-pre on `cpuAndNeuralEngine`, generator on `cpuAndGPU`), warm median of 10 runs after 3 warmups, seven inputs chosen to sit just under and just over the bucket boundaries. The duration stage is 7x to 14x faster and end-to-end time roughly halves; the masks cost 2-5% on decoder-pre, 0.3-1.5 ms on f0ntrain and under 3% on the generator.

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| input | bucket | upstream main | duration fix only | full branch |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 44 tokens, 2.8 s | 3 s | 110.0 | 54.7 | 55.5 |
| 50 tokens, 3.3 s | 7 s | 160.0 | 106.5 | 107.9 |
| 105 tokens, 6.8 s | 7 s | 232.4 | 110.7 | 112.8 |
| 113 tokens, 7.1 s | 10 s | 267.4 | 148.0 | 150.4 |
| 219 tokens, 13.9 s | 15 s | 486.1 | 229.1 | 232.6 |
| 234 tokens, 15.1 s | 30 s | 710.1 | 447.5 | 452.6 |
| 476 tokens, 27.4 s | 30 s | 1,050.2 | 474.3 | 475.9 |

### Stage medians (milliseconds)

| input | duration main → branch | f0ntrain | decoder-pre | generator |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 44 tokens, 2.8 s | 63.3 → 8.9 | 3.6 → 3.7 | 4.0 → 3.1 | 33.5 → 34.1 |
| 219 tokens, 13.9 s | 276.2 → 24.0 | 9.8 → 10.5 | 20.1 → 15.7 | 152.6 → 153.8 |
| 476 tokens, 27.4 s | 615.4 → 43.1 | 16.5 → 17.1 | 53.2 → 49.0 | 304.8 → 305.6 |

The 30 s generator varies by about 10% between passes on this machine; on the same real tensors (medians of 10 warm runs) it is 308 ms on main and 301 ms on the branch, 157 and 154 ms at 15 s.

### Cold load and memory

| | upstream main | full branch |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| first load and compile, 476 tokens | 567 s | 5 s |
| peak RSS, one synthesis incl. load, 44 tokens | 594 MB | 302 MB |
| peak RSS, one synthesis incl. load, 476 tokens | 3,051 MB | 585 MB |
| `export_duration.py`, four padded sizes | 1,248 s, 9.1 GB | 56 s, 2.1 GB |

The opt-in exact-length duration packages (`KOKORO_USE_EXACT_DURATION_MODELS=1`) take 7.4, 11.1, 20.3 and 37.2 ms on the four frozen texts; the padded path on the branch takes 8.9, 13.5, 24.0 and 43.1 ms.

### decoder-pre placement follows the bucket

decoder-pre was the one stage that scaled worse than linearly: 15 ms at 15 s but 47 ms at 30 s on the Neural Engine, with every op ANE-preferred at both sizes (compute plans identical, 265 of 265). The ANE's cost per frame rises with the axis length (16 µs at the 10 s bucket, 25 at 15 s, 39 at 30 s) while the GPU's falls (21, 20, 14.5 µs), so the two cross between the 10 s and 15 s buckets. The staged policy now keeps decoder-pre on the ANE up to the 10 s bucket and runs it on the GPU above (`PipelineConstants.decoderPreNeuralEngineMaxBucketSeconds`). Interleaved on the same build, two passes: stage 15.3 → 10.0 ms at 15 s, 47 → 17 ms at 30 s; end to end 15 s 201 → 196 ms, 15 s-in-30 s 385 → 353 ms, 30 s 406 → 374 ms; the three smaller buckets are unchanged. Measured on an M3 Max; a device with a weaker GPU may cross later, which is why the threshold is one named constant.

### Provenance

- Machine: Apple M3 Max, 36 GB, macOS 26.5.1, Xcode 26.6, coremltools 8.3.0, torch 2.6.0
- Branch: `mask-aware-bucketing` on top of upstream `fa57641`
- Packages exported locally from each commit; unchanged stages linked from the commit that last exported them, verified exact by re-export (identical op histograms, bit-identical predictions). The generator packages are the re-export after the int32 mask-alignment fix (see the debug note); the two branch columns were re-measured afterwards in one quiet window, two interleaved passes each (means shown), with the duration-fix-only column reproducing its earlier pass within 2% as the control for the main column measured earlier in the session
- Quality evidence for the same branch: [debug-notes.md](debug-notes.md), issue "Bucket padding contaminated every time-axis statistic and the f0ntrain BiLSTM"

## Bakeoff v10: PyTorch baselines on M1 Mini (Configs A/F initially blocked)

**First collected:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Partial timed results — Configs D and E complete; the A/F export blocker was resolved later on 2026-04-17 and needs a timed rerun

### Summary

Ran the controlled bakeoff on an Apple M1 Mini (16 GB, macOS 15.7.5). During
setup the pre-existing `kokoro_decoder_har_post_<N>s.mlpackage` artifacts (dated
Apr 15) were found to emit half the advertised samples (e.g. 3s bucket →
`waveform (1, 1, 36000)` instead of 72000). This made Config F trip the
canonical-duration-agreement guard: observed 1.5s vs canonical 2.8s at every
bucket. Attempting to re-export with
`uv run --no-sync python -m export_synth.main --mode decoder-har --buckets 3s,7s,10s,15s,30s -o coreml`
failed with `AttributeError: 'MaskedBidirectionalLSTM' object has no attribute 'num_layers'`,
so the HAR-post buckets could not be rebuilt in this session.

Configs D (PyTorch MPS) and E (PyTorch CPU) ran cleanly and are published
below. Config A (Python HAR-post) and Config F (Swift + Core ML) were marked
`config_unavailable` in the original v10 result file.

### Follow-up Resolution

On 2026-04-17, `export_synth/wrappers.py` was made idempotent for an already
masked `kmodel.predictor.lstm`, and the full HAR-post set was regenerated:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -m export_synth.main --mode decoder-har --buckets 3s,7s,10s,15s,30s -o coreml
```

The saved package specs now advertise the expected waveform lengths:

| Bucket | Waveform samples |
| --- | ---: |
| 3s | 72000 |
| 7s | 168000 |
| 10s | 240000 |
| 15s | 360000 |
| 30s | 720000 |

Config A and Config F both loaded as `READY` in a zero-iteration smoke run, and
Config F passed the canonical-duration-agreement guard for all four frozen
inputs. The smoke result is
`outputs/bakeoff/results_debug_af_smoke.json`. The timed v10 A/F numbers still
need to be collected in a fresh bakeoff run.

### Cross-machine comparison (D and E only)

Config D (PyTorch MPS), 30s input wall time: M2 Ultra v9 1602 ms → M1 Mini
3680 ms (**2.3× slower**). Config E (PyTorch CPU), 30s: M2 Ultra v9 2714 ms →
M1 Mini 8074 ms (**3.0× slower**).

| Input | D (M2 Ultra, v9) | D (M1 Mini) | Mini/Ultra | E (M2 Ultra, v9) | E (M1 Mini) | Mini/Ultra |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| 15s | 673 ms | 1847 ms | 2.7× | 1467 ms | 4007 ms | 2.7× |
| 30s | 1602 ms | 3680 ms | 2.3× | 2714 ms | 8074 ms | 3.0× |

### Interpretation

1. **M1 Mini is ~2–3× slower than M2 Ultra on the PyTorch baselines.** Gap
   widens slightly on long inputs and on CPU, consistent with the Ultra's
   larger GPU and memory bandwidth.
2. **E/D ratio on M1 Mini is ~2.2× at long inputs** (8074 / 3680), roughly
   matching M2 Ultra's E/D ratio (~1.7× at 30s). MPS still pays off on the
   Mini, but less dramatically.
3. **No Config F numbers here.** The half-samples `decoder_har_post` artifacts
   are an upstream export bug, not a Swift-pipeline regression. Once
   `export_synth` is fixed and the HAR-post mlpackages are re-exported, this
   machine should be re-bakedoff for A and F.

  - `export_synth.main --mode decoder-har` raises
    `AttributeError: 'MaskedBidirectionalLSTM' object has no attribute 'num_layers'`
    on the current repo; fix required before the HAR-post mlpackages can be
    regenerated.

## Bakeoff v9: Config F host-materialization fix on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Reran the full counterbalanced A/D/E/F bakeoff after fixing Config F's Swift
host-side materialization costs. F now beats the fixed Config A HAR-post path at
every canonical input length. The long-form loss in v8 was not the exact
Duration graph; it was two avoidable Swift/MLMultiArray costs after Core ML
prediction:

- building a sparse one-hot alignment matrix and multiplying through zeros
- extracting a strided `Float16` waveform through boxed `MLMultiArray`
  subscripting during trim

Config F now expands token states to frames directly and reads typed
`MLMultiArray` storage with stride-aware `Float32`/`Float16` paths. Tensor dumps
still materialize the full alignment/waveform only when requested.

| `config_f_30s.wav` | 27.375s | 4301.8 | 86.326% | 10.974% | `needs_listening` |

### Interpretation

1. **F now beats A at every tested length.** In the full controlled run, F is
   `1.8-5.9x` faster than the fixed HAR-post Config A path.
2. **The v8 long-form loss was host work, not model work.** Exact Duration
   remains `10-52 ms`; the old 30s loss came mostly from matrix and trim
   materialization.
3. **Typed, stride-aware access matters.** The Swift waveform output is a
   strided `Float16` `MLMultiArray`, so a contiguous `Float32` fast path alone
   does not help trim.
4. **Load-time Core ML warnings are separate from timed medians.** The combined
   run still emitted occasional `manifest.plist` load warnings while Core ML
   revalidated compiled assets, but the subprocess exited cleanly and produced
   80/80 ok records.

## Bakeoff v8: Exact Duration rerun on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-16
**Completed:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Complete; superseded by v9 for Config F performance

### Summary

Reran the bakeoff after integrating exact fixed-shape native Duration packages
into the normal export/setup flow. The first combined `a,d,e,f` run exposed a
Config A setup bug: A initialized `HybridTTSPipeline()` and auto-loaded every
Core ML package discoverable under `coreml/`, then loaded the HAR-post buckets
again explicitly. That made A spend minutes in unrelated Core ML AOT
respecialization before benchmark availability output.

The harness now initializes Config A with `HybridTTSPipeline(force_engine="pytorch")`
and explicitly loads only the intended HAR-post bucket set with
`compute_units=ALL`. Config A, D, E, and F all completed 20/20 ok records.
Config F uses exact native Duration packages for all canonical inputs and keeps
the corrected frame counts: `112`, `270`, `556`, and `1095`. The v8 long-form
loss was later traced to Swift host materialization and fixed in v9.

### Config A setup fix

The combined `a,d,e,f` run and the standalone `a` run both stayed in Python
Core ML model load for several minutes before any Config A availability output.
Process sampling showed:

```text
MLE5ProgramLibraryOnDeviceAOTCompilationImpl createProgramLibraryHandleWithRespecialization
_ANEClient compileModel
```

Root cause: Config A was auto-loading unrelated Core ML packages through
`HybridTTSPipeline()` before replacing the bucket dictionary with explicit
HAR-post packages. The fix skips auto Core ML discovery for A and loads only
`kokoro_decoder_har_post_{3,7,10,15,30}s.mlpackage`.

### Interpretation

1. **Config A is fixed as a benchmark harness path.** It now reaches
   availability and completes all canonical inputs instead of blocking in
   unrelated package AOT compilation.
2. **Config F wins at short lengths and remains the fastest non-A baseline.**
   F beats A at 3s and 7s, but A is still faster at 15s and 30s.
3. **F's remaining long-form cost is not Duration.** Exact Duration medians are
   `9.8/13.2/27.3/47.1 ms`; the larger F costs are matrix/HN-SF/trim
   materialization.
4. **D/E are no longer competitive on this run.** F beats PyTorch MPS by
   `1.4-1.9x` and CPU by `2.5-4.1x`.

## Bakeoff v7: Duration-correct Config F on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-16
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Reran the complete A/D/E/F bakeoff after fixing Config F Duration padding
semantics for all enum shapes. This run proves Config F now produces
canonical-duration audio, but it also shows the corrected Swift/Core ML path is
slower than Config A at every length on this M2 Ultra.

The fix replaced padded bidirectional LSTM execution in the Duration export
with mask-aware recurrent unrolls. That restores audio parity, but it makes the
large static Duration graphs expensive, especially `T=512`.

### Audio gate

Before the bakeoff, Config F listen samples were regenerated with:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python scripts/bakeoff_listen.py --quality-plots
```

All four samples passed the waveform health gate:

| Input | Observed duration | RMS | Active32 | ZCR | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 3s | `2.800s` | `4607.8` | `78.863%` | `9.128%` | `needs_listening` |
| 7s | `6.750s` | `4500.8` | `84.739%` | `10.063%` | `needs_listening` |
| 15s | `13.900s` | `5147.8` | `86.396%` | `10.785%` | `needs_listening` |
| 30s | `27.400s` | `4309.6` | `86.300%` | `10.937%` | `needs_listening` |

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3s | 2.80s | **162 ms** | 188 ms | 349 ms | 169 ms |
| 7s | 6.75s | **247 ms** | 345 ms | 642 ms | 368 ms |
| 15s | 13.90s | **482 ms** | 640 ms | 1224 ms | 766 ms |
| 30s | 27.38s | **713 ms** | 1340 ms | 2231 ms | 1595 ms |

### RTF

| 30s | **0.026** | 0.049 | 0.082 | 0.058 |

### Speedup: Config F vs baselines

| Input | F vs A (Python HAR) | F vs D (MPS) | F vs E (CPU) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3s | 1.0x | **1.1x** | **2.1x** |
| 7s | 0.7x | 0.9x | **1.7x** |
| 15s | 0.6x | 0.8x | **1.6x** |
| 30s | 0.4x | 0.8x | **1.4x** |

### Interpretation

1. **Config A is not cheating.** It produces valid, canonical-duration audio and
   remains the fastest path after Config F is made duration-correct.
2. **Config F is now correct, not fast.** The old shorter outputs were invalid
   for performance comparison. After padding semantics are fixed, F no longer
   wins against A.
3. **The fixed Duration stage is a new bottleneck.** Median Config F duration
   time is `78 ms`, `157 ms`, `342 ms`, and `751 ms` for 3s/7s/15s/30s.
4. **Waveform materialization remains expensive.** Median Config F trim/output
   materialization is `43 ms`, `99 ms`, `220 ms`, and `433 ms` across the same
   lengths.
5. **The largest hidden cost is first-use compile/load.** T=512 Duration
   warmup requires minutes inside Core ML's E5/ANE compiler. The harness timeout
   was raised so publication runs do not falsely mark F as dead during warmup.

## Bakeoff v6: Audio-fixed Config F on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-16
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Reran the complete A/D/E/F bakeoff on the Mac Studio M2 Ultra after fixing the
Config F waveform extraction bug, replacing the weak listen gate, and tightening
the benchmark so Config F always materializes the trimmed waveform inside the
timed path. This run is the first post-fix M2 Ultra bakeoff where Config F
listen samples were generated with the stride-safe Swift runtime, all four
enumerated listen shapes passed the objective audio gate, and the short/medium
samples were human-confirmed before performance numbers were accepted.

**Config F produces human-sounding audio and beats PyTorch CPU/MPS at every
duration**, but it is not the universal winner against Config A once waveform
extraction is included in the timed Swift path. Relative to Config A (Python
HAR-post), the Swift/Core ML path is `1.5x` faster at 3s, roughly tied at 7s,
and slower at 15s/30s. Relative to PyTorch CPU, it remains `2.5-3.3x` faster.

### Audio gate

Before this bakeoff, the listen samples were regenerated with:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python scripts/bakeoff_listen.py --keys 3s,7s,15s,30s
```

All four listen samples recorded `quality_pass=true` and
`quality_decision=needs_listening`:

| Input | WAV | RMS | Active32 | ZCR |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3s | `outputs/bakeoff/listen/config_f_3s.wav` | `4708.0` | `75.668%` | `8.578%` |
| 7s | `outputs/bakeoff/listen/config_f_7s.wav` | `4885.2` | `83.437%` | `10.078%` |
| 15s | `outputs/bakeoff/listen/config_f_15s.wav` | `5282.6` | `87.239%` | `10.858%` |
| 30s | `outputs/bakeoff/listen/config_f_30s.wav` | `4204.1` | `86.033%` | `11.146%` |

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | Bucket | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| 30s | 27.38s | 30s | **692 ms** | 1288 ms | 2190 ms | 881 ms |

### RTF and realtime factor

| Input | Audio | A RTF | D RTF | E RTF | F RTF | F realtime |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| 30s | 27.38s | **0.025** | 0.047 | 0.080 | 0.032 | 31x RT |

### Speedup: Config F vs baselines

| Input | F vs A (Python HAR) | F vs D (MPS) | F vs E (CPU) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3s | **1.5x** | **1.9x** | **3.3x** |
| 7s | **1.1x** | **1.5x** | **2.8x** |
| 15s | 0.9x | **1.4x** | **2.6x** |
| 30s | 0.8x | **1.5x** | **2.5x** |

### Interpretation

1. **The speed result is now tied to human-audible output.** The previous
   bakeoff winner was invalid because its listen samples were near-silent. This
   v6 run was only accepted after objective gates passed and short/medium clips
   were human-confirmed.

2. **Config F remains a valid fast path, but not always the fastest path.** The
   Swift/Core ML pipeline beats PyTorch CPU and PyTorch MPS at every enumerated
   shape, but Config A is faster at 15s and 30s on this M2 Ultra run.

3. **The benchmark now includes waveform extraction.** The earlier post-fix
   timing that showed Config F winning everywhere did not materialize the
   waveform in the timed Config F path. The corrected measurement is stricter
   and more product-representative.

4. **MPS fallback remains slower than Config F.** The PyTorch MPS path emitted
   the expected `aten::angle` CPU fallback warning and was 1.4-1.9x slower than
   Config F across the enumerated shapes.

### Plan reference

Audio parity recovery plan Phase 7:
`README/Plans/005-kokoro-audio-parity-recovery-plan.md`

## End-to-end latency

| Preset | Audio returned | Repo warm median | HF warm median | Repo vs HF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `1.5s` | `121 ms` | `108 ms` | Repo is `12.5%` slower |
| `long` | `5.0s` | `303 ms` | `262 ms` | Repo is `15.4%` slower |

Equivalent steady-state RTF from the same run:

| Preset | Repo warm RTF | HF warm RTF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `0.081` | `0.072` |
| `long` | `0.061` | `0.052` |

## First-call latency

These are the first measured `synthesize()` calls after the pipeline object was created:

| Preset | Repo cold wall | HF cold wall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `529 ms` | `337 ms` |
| `long` | `529 ms` | `574 ms` |

Treat these as directional only. The `long` case was measured after the `tiny` case in the same session, so it is not a pure fresh-process cold start.

## Pipeline init in this harness

Python-side pipeline construction in this benchmark took:

- repo init: `198.3s`
- HF init: `190.6s`

This is real for this script, but it should **not** be treated as the final app-level startup number without a separate startup-focused benchmark.

## Takeaway

For the metric we actually care about, **the current local HAR-post packages are slower than the HF baseline** on both tested end-to-end requests.

- `tiny`: local `121 ms` vs HF `108 ms`
- `long`: local `303 ms` vs HF `262 ms`

So the current answer is: **the new version is not faster in end-to-end latency on this run**.

## Where the slowdown shows up

To explain the latency gap, I reran the same local-vs-HF comparison with stage timing around the HAR-post path:

1. `extract_vocoder_inputs()`
2. bucket pick
3. CPU tensor build via `build_decoder_har_post_inputs_np`
4. Core ML `predict()`
5. trim
6. residual / orchestration remainder

This stage replay uses the same pipeline code and package swap, but times the HAR-post path directly instead of only wrapping `pipe.synthesize(...)`.

### Warm stage breakdown: `tiny`

| Stage | Repo | HF | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| extract vocoder inputs | `49.9 ms` | `41.5 ms` | repo `+8.4 ms` |
| bucket pick | `0.021 ms` | `0.020 ms` | noise |
| build inputs | `36.0 ms` | `33.7 ms` | repo `+2.3 ms` |
| Core ML `predict()` | `19.9 ms` | `19.1 ms` | repo `+0.8 ms` |
| trim | `0.016 ms` | `0.013 ms` | noise |
| residual | `0.001 ms` | `0.001 ms` | noise |
| total | `107.9 ms` | `94.0 ms` | repo `+13.9 ms` |

### Warm stage breakdown: `long`

| Stage | Repo | HF | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| extract vocoder inputs | `128.6 ms` | `119.4 ms` | repo `+9.2 ms` |
| bucket pick | `0.022 ms` | `0.021 ms` | noise |
| build inputs | `77.0 ms` | `83.8 ms` | repo `-6.8 ms` |
| Core ML `predict()` | `43.9 ms` | `42.0 ms` | repo `+1.9 ms` |
| trim | `0.015 ms` | `0.015 ms` | noise |
| residual | `0.001 ms` | `0.002 ms` | noise |
| total | `250.6 ms` | `244.6 ms` | repo `+6.0 ms` |

### Interpretation

The slowdown is **not** coming from one massive regression inside Core ML. On these runs:

- The largest repeated penalty is **`extract_vocoder_inputs()`**:
  - about `+8.4 ms` on `tiny`
  - about `+9.2 ms` on `long`
- There is also a smaller but real **Core ML `predict()`** penalty:
  - about `+0.8 ms` on `tiny`
  - about `+1.9 ms` on `long`
- The CPU-side HAR-post tensor build is:
  - a little slower on `tiny`
  - actually faster on `long`

So the current regression appears to be **mostly in the shared prefix path**, with a smaller contribution from the Core ML inference itself.

## ANE optimization experiment: nn.Linear → nn.Conv1d in AdaIN1d — Resolved (reverted)

**First spotted:** 2026-04-14
**Resolved:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** Resolved — hypothesis disproved, Conv1d change reverted, dead code cleanup kept

### Summary

Cross-referenced the [CoreML Compute Unit Scheduling Guide](../Guides/apple-silicon/CoreML-Compute-Unit-Scheduling-guide.md) against the production `GeneratorFromHar` ANE path. The Orion reverse-engineering project (Constraint #17) claims matmul executes 3x slower than 1x1 convolution on the ANE. We replaced `nn.Linear` with `nn.Conv1d(kernel_size=1)` in `AdaIN1d.fc` — dozens of instances in the hot ANE path. **Result: no improvement.** Core ML `predict()` time was unchanged or marginally worse. CoreML's MIL compiler very likely lowers `linear` ops to conv internally (inferred from identical predict times, not MIL-dump verified), making the source-level change redundant. The largest measured latency gap (vs HF baseline packages) appears in `extract_vocoder_inputs()`, the PyTorch CPU prefix path — though this needs a dedicated prefix-only A/B to rule out measurement noise (see caveats below). Note: the CPU-side `build inputs` stage was actually 6.8 ms *faster* for the repo on the `long` input, partially offsetting the predict penalty — the overall picture is mixed, not uniformly worse.

### What we did

1. **Audited the GeneratorFromHar traced graph** for ANE-incompatible ops per the scheduling guide:
   - `torch.cat` (Orion Constraint #1: banned on ANE) — found in `AdaIN1d.forward()` at `istftnet.py:154-155`, but confirmed it was **dead code**: the padding branch only fires when `C != num_features`, which never happens because `AdaIN1d` is always constructed with `num_features == channels`.
   - `nn.Linear` (Orion Constraint #17: matmul 3x slower than Conv on ANE) — found in `AdaIN1d.fc` at `istftnet.py:129`. Each `AdaINResBlock1` has 6 `AdaIN1d` instances. The Generator has `num_upsamples * num_kernels` resblocks plus `num_upsamples` noise_res blocks — dozens of Linear forward calls on the ANE per inference.
   - No `nn.GELU` (clean — uses LeakyReLU and Snake activations).
   - Tensor layout already `(B, C, T)` mapping to ANE's preferred `(B, C, 1, S)`.

2. **Removed dead `torch.cat` code** in `AdaIN1d.forward()` — replaced the slice/pad branch with `assert C == self.num_features`. This cleanup is kept (not reverted) because it removes code that could never execute and would have introduced an ANE-banned concat op if it somehow did.

3. **Replaced `nn.Linear` with `nn.Conv1d(kernel_size=1)`** in `AdaIN1d.__init__`:
   ```python
   # Before
   self.fc = nn.Linear(style_dim, num_features * 2)
   # After
   self.fc = nn.Conv1d(style_dim, num_features * 2, kernel_size=1)
   ```
   Adjusted `forward()` to unsqueeze style input for Conv1d. Added `register_load_state_dict_pre_hook` to reshape pretrained Linear weights `(out, in)` → `(out, in, 1)` for checkpoint compatibility.

4. **Re-exported decoder HAR post buckets** (3s, 10s) with the Conv1d-based AdaIN1d.

5. **Benchmarked** local repo packages vs HF baseline packages (which still use nn.Linear) using identical text, voice, and pipeline code.

### What we learned

**Core ML predict() — no improvement:**

| Input | Repo (Conv1d) | HF (Linear) | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tiny | 19.9 ms | 19.1 ms | +0.8 ms (worse) |
| long | 43.9 ms | 42.0 ms | +1.9 ms (worse) |

**Conclusion:** CoreML's MIL compiler very likely optimizes `linear` → conv internally during the `.mlpackage` compilation/specialization step — inferred from the identical predict() times, not directly verified with a MIL before/after dump. The source-level Conv1d change appears redundant. Orion Constraint #17 likely applies to **direct ANE programming** (bypassing CoreML), not to the CoreML conversion pipeline. A definitive proof would require dumping the MIL graph (e.g. via `ct.models.MLModel._mil_program`) for both variants and comparing the lowered ops.

**The real regression is in the PyTorch CPU prefix:**

| Input | Stage | Repo | HF | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tiny | extract_vocoder_inputs | 49.9 ms | 41.5 ms | +8.4 ms |
| long | extract_vocoder_inputs | 128.6 ms | 119.4 ms | +9.2 ms |

This +8-9ms penalty is consistent across inputs and dwarfs the Core ML predict delta. It lives in the shared PyTorch path (duration model + alignment + hn-nsf), which the Conv1d change does not touch.

**Caveat:** The stage breakdown swapped only decoder `.mlpackage` files between repo and HF; the prefix extraction code was identical in both runs. A consistent +8-9ms delta on a shared code path is suspicious — it may reflect run-to-run thermal/cache variance, process ordering effects (repo always ran first), or genuine codebase drift. A dedicated prefix-only A/B with interleaved runs and higher iteration count is needed to confirm this as a real regression vs. measurement noise.

### Key takeaways for future work

1. **Don't optimize what CoreML likely already optimizes.** The MIL compiler's internal lowering passes very likely handle Linear → Conv conversion (inferred from identical predict times). Source-level changes to match Orion constraints likely only matter when programming the ANE directly (bypassing CoreML). Verify with a MIL dump if this assumption becomes load-bearing.
2. **Profile before optimizing.** The stage breakdown showed the bottleneck was in the PyTorch prefix, not the ANE decoder. Without the breakdown, we'd have spent more time on the wrong problem.
3. **The dead `torch.cat` removal was valid.** Even though it was dead code, removing it prevents future accidental activation and eliminates an ANE-banned op from the source.
4. **The `extract_vocoder_inputs()` gap needs a dedicated A/B.** A +8-9ms delta across inputs is suggestive but not conclusive — the stage breakdown only swapped decoder packages while prefix code was identical, so the delta may reflect thermal/ordering effects rather than a real regression. A prefix-only interleaved A/B benchmark is needed before committing to an optimization effort there.

## Bakeoff v2: Controlled five-config benchmark on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete (powermetrics telemetry deferred; M1 Mini data collected — see below)

### Summary

Controlled benchmark of the shipping HAR-post path against PyTorch CPU/MPS baselines and a naive decoder-only Core ML control artifact. Five configs, four frozen inputs, five counterbalanced repetitions on Apple M2 Ultra (64 GB). The shipping hybrid path (Config A) is **2.6–3.5x faster than PyTorch CPU** on medium-to-long inputs and **18–30x realtime**, but CPU-side overhead still consumes ~80% of wall time.

### What was measured

- **Config A:** Shipping hybrid HAR-post path (`coreml/kokoro_decoder_har_post_{3,10}s.mlpackage`)
- **Config B:** Naive decoder-only 10s artifact, `compute_units=ALL`
- **Config C:** Naive decoder-only 10s artifact, `compute_units=CPU_AND_GPU`
- **Config D:** PyTorch end-to-end on MPS (`PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`)
- **Config E:** PyTorch end-to-end on CPU

All configs used identical frozen inputs, `voice=af_heart`, `speed=1.0`, `torch.manual_seed(0)`.

### Method

- Harness: `scripts/bakeoff_harness.py` with `run --configs a,b,c,d,e --iterations 5 --order-seed 0`
- All models preloaded and warmed before timed iterations
- Config A uses explicit-path artifact loading with SHA256 recorded
- Counterbalanced: config and input order independently shuffled per repetition via `random.Random(order_seed + rep)`
- Timer: `time.perf_counter()` wall clock, MPS sync before stop for Config D
- Each iteration is one full text-to-waveform pass (text processing through final numpy array)

### Inputs

| Key | Text | Audio duration | Bucket |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `"Hello world!"` | `1.55s` | `3s` |
| `short` | `"The quick brown fox jumps over the dog."` | `2.80s` | `3s` |
| `medium` | `"This is a longer sentence...running on the Apple GPU."` | `6.58s` | `10s` |
| `long` | `"This is a longer sentence...A few more words added here."` | `8.35s` | `10s` |

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | A (HAR-post) | B (.all) | C (.cpuAndGPU) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `1.55s` | `151 ms` | `137 ms` | `182 ms` | `215 ms` | `258 ms` |
| `short` | `2.80s` | `155 ms` | `176 ms` | `177 ms` | `287 ms` | `396 ms` |
| `medium` | `6.58s` | `283 ms` | `189 ms` | `184 ms` | `351 ms` | `782 ms` |
| `long` | `8.35s` | `274 ms` | `214 ms` | `238 ms` | `436 ms` | `966 ms` |

### RTF (canonical audio duration / wall time)

| Input | A (HAR-post) | B (.all) | C (.cpuAndGPU) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `0.097` (10x RT) | `0.089` | `0.117` | `0.139` | `0.167` |
| `short` | `0.055` (18x RT) | `0.063` | `0.063` | `0.103` | `0.142` |
| `medium` | `0.043` (23x RT) | `0.029` | `0.028` | `0.053` | `0.119` |
| `long` | `0.033` (30x RT) | `0.026` | `0.029` | `0.052` | `0.116` |

### Speedup: Config A vs PyTorch baselines

| Input | Audio | A vs E (CPU) | A vs D (MPS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `1.55s` | `1.7x` | `1.4x` |
| `short` | `2.80s` | `2.6x` | `1.9x` |
| `medium` | `6.58s` | `2.8x` | `1.2x` |
| `long` | `8.35s` | `3.5x` | `1.6x` |

The advantage grows with sequence length because Core ML predict time scales sublinearly while PyTorch CPU scales linearly.

### Config A stage breakdown (warm median)

| Input | Bucket | Prefix extract | HAR builder (CPU) | CoreML predict | Orchestration | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `3s` | `52.7 ms` (35%) | `40.9 ms` (27%) | `57.0 ms` (38%) | `2.0 ms` | `151 ms` |
| `short` | `3s` | `92.4 ms` (60%) | `39.9 ms` (26%) | `19.1 ms` (12%) | `2.0 ms` | `155 ms` |
| `medium` | `10s` | `109.5 ms` (39%) | `80.4 ms` (28%) | `84.0 ms` (30%) | `2.0 ms` | `283 ms` |
| `long` | `10s` | `127.0 ms` (46%) | `85.7 ms` (31%) | `47.5 ms` (17%) | `1.9 ms` | `274 ms` |

### Interpretation

1. **Config A is 18–30x realtime on M2 Ultra.** Even the shortest input (`tiny`, 1.55s audio) completes in 151 ms. The longest input (`long`, 8.35s audio) completes in 274 ms.

2. **CPU-side overhead dominates.** Across all inputs, `extract_vocoder_inputs()` + `build_decoder_har_post_inputs_np()` together consume 62–86% of wall time. Core ML `predict()` is only 12–38% of wall time — already fast, with limited room for further ANE optimization to improve end-to-end latency.

3. **The speedup scales with duration.** At `tiny` (1.55s), Config A is only 1.7x faster than CPU because the fixed prefix overhead dominates. At `long` (8.35s), the speedup reaches 3.5x because Core ML predict scales sublinearly while the prefix cost grows slowly.

4. **MPS is worse than expected.** Config D (PyTorch MPS with fallback) shows high variance and only modest improvement over CPU. This is consistent with known `aten::angle` fallback overhead on MPS — treat Config D as the path-of-least-resistance MPS baseline, not the GPU ceiling.

5. **Configs B and C (decoder-only) have similar latency.** Without powermetrics telemetry, Gate 1 (ANE participation under `.all`) is **indeterminate** from timing alone. B and C differ by <15% on most inputs, which is within thermal/scheduling noise. Telemetry loops with `sudo powermetrics` are needed for a definitive answer.

6. **The predict-time variance on `tiny` is notable.** Config A's Core ML predict shows `57 ms` on the 3s bucket for `tiny` but only `19 ms` for `short` (also 3s bucket). This likely reflects first-bucket compilation/warmup effects even after the general warmup pass, since `tiny` and `short` may not always warm the same bucket.

### Comparison to prior anecdotal numbers

The earlier section of this document reported repo HAR-post warm medians of `121 ms` (tiny) and `303 ms` (long) in a less controlled two-input comparison. The bakeoff numbers (`151 ms` tiny, `274 ms` long) are in the same ballpark but not directly comparable:

- The bakeoff uses counterbalanced ordering (prior test ran sequentially)
- The bakeoff uses a different `long` text (`~8.35s` vs `~5.0s` in the prior test)
- The bakeoff `tiny` is slightly slower, consistent with counterbalanced ordering disrupting cache locality

The +12–15% gap vs HF baseline packages reported earlier is **not re-tested** in this bakeoff because all five configs use the same local repo artifacts. The gap remains a known issue (see above).

## Swift prefix rewrite: per-stage latency measurements

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Phase 3 complete (per-stage benchmarks; DecoderPre bridge; full bakeoff comparison deferred)

### Summary

Measured every stage of the proposed Swift prefix rewrite pipeline on M2 Ultra. The Duration model (BERT + predictor) runs 3.8x faster as CoreML vs PyTorch. The F0Ntrain prosody model exports to CoreML with 0.999995 correlation and runs in 3-23 ms depending on bucket. The hn-nsf harmonic source (SineGen + STFT) runs in native Swift at 14-45 ms with Double-precision phase accumulation, down from 166 ms after optimizing bulk noise generation. The DecoderPre stage remains a PyTorch bridge pending CoreML export (Phase 4, conditional on AdaIN).

### Individual stage latencies (warm median, M2 Ultra)

| Stage | 3s bucket | 10s bucket | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duration CoreML | 13.6 ms | 13.6 ms | Fixed 128-token input, `compute_units=ALL`. 3.8x vs ~50 ms PyTorch. |
| Alignment + matrix ops | ~1 ms | ~1 ms | Swift. Two matrix multiplies on small tensors. |
| F0Ntrain CoreML | 3.1 ms | 23.4 ms | T=120 (3s) / T=400 (10s). Correlation 0.9999+. |
| Padding | ~0.5 ms | ~0.5 ms | Zero-fill to bucket geometry. |
| DecoderPre (PyTorch bridge) | 44.7 ms | 103.8 ms | **Bottleneck.** PyTorch decoder stack. Phase 4 target. |
| hn-nsf Swift (Accelerate) | 14 ms | 45 ms | Double-precision phase, bulk noise gen, vvsin. |
| GeneratorFromHar CoreML | 16.7 ms | 41.0 ms | `compute_units=ALL`. Same models as bakeoff v2. |

### Estimated pipeline totals

| Configuration | 3s bucket | 10s bucket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Swift + bridge** (current) | ~94 ms | ~228 ms |
| **Swift + CoreML DecoderPre** (Phase 4) | ~49 ms | ~125 ms |
| **Python Config A** (bakeoff v2) | 151 ms | 274 ms |
| **PyTorch MPS** (bakeoff v2) | 215–287 ms | 351–436 ms |

### Speedup vs baselines

| Configuration | vs Python Config A (3s / 10s) | vs MPS (3s / 10s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swift + bridge | 1.6x / 1.2x | 2.3x / 1.5x |
| Swift + CoreML DecoderPre | 3.1x / 2.2x | **4.4x / 2.8x** |

MPS is the natural "just use the GPU" baseline. The Swift pipeline beats it by 2–4x because MPS suffers from `aten::angle` CPU fallback overhead and Python interpreter costs, while Swift+CoreML routes compute to the ANE with zero Python overhead.

### hn-nsf optimization log

The initial naive Swift implementation ran at 166 ms (3s) and 554 ms (10s) — **slower than PyTorch**. Profiling identified per-sample Gaussian RNG (`Float.gaussianRandom` via Box-Muller with `RandomNumberGenerator` protocol dispatch) as the bottleneck at 154 ms / 648k calls. Replacing with bulk `generateGaussianNoise()` (pre-allocated buffer, direct xorshift64, no protocol dispatch) reduced hn-nsf to 14 ms (3s) and 45 ms (10s) — a **12x speedup**.

### Key findings

1. **DecoderPre is the new bottleneck.** At 44-104 ms, it's 48-46% of total pipeline time (with bridge). The rest of the pipeline is already fast enough.

2. **Duration CoreML is 3.8x faster than PyTorch.** 13.6 ms vs ~50 ms. This was an unknown prior to this measurement — the plan's latency budget had it marked as UNKNOWN.

3. **F0Ntrain exports cleanly to CoreML.** Despite containing AdainResBlk1d (the same module type that caused issues in the decoder-only export), F0Ntrain achieves correlation 0.9999+. The AdaIN broadcast issue may be graph-size dependent.

4. **hn-nsf Swift matches PyTorch speed** after optimization. The 14-45 ms range is comparable to the 30-40 ms PyTorch HAR builder that includes decoder-pre + hn-nsf. The Swift hn-nsf alone is slightly slower than PyTorch hn-nsf alone, but eliminates Python interpreter overhead.

5. **The "< 30 ms pre-decoder" target from the plan is not achievable with the bridge.** Pre-decoder with bridge is ~77 ms (3s) / ~187 ms (10s). Without the bridge (Phase 4), it would be ~32 ms (3s) / ~83 ms (10s) — close to target for 3s, over for 10s.

### Phase 4 update: DecoderPre CoreML export succeeded

The AdaIN export risk did NOT materialize. DecoderPre (F0_conv + N_conv + encode + decode blocks) exports to CoreML with correlation 1.000000 (3s) and 0.999999 (10s). The debug-notes decoder-only issue was specific to SourceModuleHnNSF, not the decode blocks.

## Bakeoff v3: Swift pipeline (Config F) vs Python baselines

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete (M2 Ultra; M2 Air deferred to Phase 7)

### Summary

Controlled counterbalanced comparison of the Swift+CoreML pipeline (Config F) against Python HAR-post (Config A), PyTorch MPS (Config D), and PyTorch CPU (Config E). Same methodology as bakeoff v2: 4 frozen inputs, 5 counterbalanced repetitions, warm median. Config F is **1.5-2.7x faster than PyTorch MPS**, **1.4-1.7x faster than Python HAR-post**, and **2.7-5.1x faster than PyTorch CPU**, achieving **18-51x realtime** on M2 Ultra.

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tiny | 1.55s | 122 ms | 127 ms | 233 ms | **86 ms** |
| short | 2.80s | 136 ms | 190 ms | 358 ms | **84 ms** |
| medium | 6.58s | 232 ms | 348 ms | 655 ms | **166 ms** |
| long | 8.35s | 286 ms | 449 ms | 848 ms | **165 ms** |

### RTF (wall time / audio duration)

| Input | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tiny | 0.079 (13x RT) | 0.082 | 0.150 | **0.055 (18x RT)** |
| short | 0.048 (21x RT) | 0.068 | 0.128 | **0.030 (34x RT)** |
| medium | 0.035 (28x RT) | 0.053 | 0.099 | **0.025 (40x RT)** |
| long | 0.034 (29x RT) | 0.054 | 0.102 | **0.020 (51x RT)** |

### Speedup: Config F vs baselines

| Input | F vs A (Python HAR) | F vs D (MPS) | F vs E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tiny | 1.4x | 1.5x | 2.7x |
| short | 1.6x | 2.3x | 4.3x |
| medium | 1.4x | 2.1x | 3.9x |
| long | 1.7x | 2.7x | 5.1x |

### Gate 6: How much faster is the Swift pipeline vs MPS and Python?

**vs MPS (the "just use the GPU" baseline):** Config F is **1.5-2.7x faster** than PyTorch MPS. MPS suffers from `aten::angle` CPU fallback and Python interpreter overhead. The Swift+CoreML path routes compute to the ANE with zero Python overhead. The gap grows with input length because MPS scales linearly while CoreML scales sublinearly.

**vs Python HAR-post:** Config F is **1.4-1.7x faster** than Config A. The speedup is modest because both pipelines share the same GeneratorFromHar CoreML predict call — the irreducible floor. The savings come from replacing PyTorch CPU inference (Duration, F0Ntrain, DecoderPre) with CoreML and eliminating Python orchestration overhead.

### Interpretation

1. **Config F beats MPS by 1.5-2.7x everywhere.** This is the key result. MPS is what a developer reaches for first on Apple Silicon ("just use the GPU"), and the Swift+CoreML pipeline decisively beats it across all input lengths. The gap grows with duration because MPS scales linearly while CoreML scales sublinearly.

2. **Config F achieves 18-51x realtime.** The fastest result is `long` at 165ms for 8.35s audio = 51x realtime. Even `tiny` (86ms for 1.55s) is 18x realtime.

3. **The speedup vs Python HAR-post is consistent (1.4-1.7x)** rather than scaling dramatically with input length. Both pipelines share the same GeneratorFromHar CoreML predict call, which is the irreducible floor.

4. **Config F vs CPU scales strongly with length.** 2.7x at tiny, 5.1x at long — because PyTorch CPU scales linearly with sequence length while the CoreML models scale sublinearly.

## Bakeoff v4: Extended duration range (3s-30s) on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Extended the bakeoff to cover the full range of practical audio durations: 3s, 7s, 15s, and 30s. Required exporting new bucket models (7s, 15s, 30s) and Duration models at enumerated token sizes [32, 64, 128, 256, 512]. The Swift pipeline (Config F) scales sublinearly — 30s of audio in 349 ms = **79x realtime** — and the speedup vs PyTorch CPU grows to **6.2x** at 30s.

### What changed from v3

- **Inputs:** Renamed from tiny/short/medium/long to 3s/7s/15s/30s targeting specific audio durations
- **Duration model:** Per-size exports [32, 64, 128, 256, 512] (E5RT can't handle RangeDim/EnumeratedShapes)
- **New bucket models:** 7s, 15s, 30s for F0Ntrain, DecoderPre, and GeneratorFromHar (all pass 0.99+ correlation)
- **New bucket models:** 7s, 15s, 30s for F0Ntrain, DecoderPre, and GeneratorFromHar (all pass 0.99+ correlation)
- **Config D (MPS)** added in a separate pass with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | Bucket | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 2.80s | 3s | 161 ms | 171 ms | 324 ms | **65 ms** |
| 7s | 6.75s | 7s | 219 ms | 320 ms | 588 ms | **142 ms** |
| 15s | 13.90s | 15s | 276 ms | 611 ms | 1133 ms | **254 ms** |
| 30s | 27.38s | 30s | 435 ms | 1247 ms | 2162 ms | **349 ms** |

### RTF and realtime factor

| Input | Audio | A RTF | D RTF | E RTF | F RTF | F realtime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 2.80s | 0.058 | 0.061 | 0.116 | **0.023** | **43x RT** |
| 7s | 6.75s | 0.032 | 0.047 | 0.087 | **0.021** | **48x RT** |
| 15s | 13.90s | 0.020 | 0.044 | 0.082 | **0.018** | **55x RT** |
| 30s | 27.38s | 0.016 | 0.046 | 0.079 | **0.013** | **79x RT** |

### Speedup: Config F vs baselines

| Input | F vs A (Python HAR) | F vs D (MPS) | F vs E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | **2.5x** | **2.6x** | **5.0x** |
| 7s | **1.5x** | **2.3x** | **4.1x** |
| 15s | **1.1x** | **2.4x** | **4.5x** |
| 30s | **1.2x** | **3.6x** | **6.2x** |

### Interpretation

1. **F vs MPS grows from 2.6x to 3.6x with duration.** This is the headline result. MPS is the natural "just use the GPU" baseline, and the Swift+CoreML pipeline beats it decisively — and the gap widens with longer inputs. At 30s, MPS takes 1.25s vs Swift's 349ms. The `aten::angle` CPU fallback on MPS and Python interpreter overhead are the primary reasons MPS falls behind.

2. **Config F scales sublinearly with duration.** 3s audio -> 65 ms, 30s audio -> 349 ms. A 10x increase in audio duration costs only 5.4x more wall time. At 30s, Config F achieves 79x realtime. MPS and CPU both scale linearly.

3. **F vs A (Python HAR-post) is largest at short durations (2.5x at 3s)** where Python orchestration overhead dominates. At 15s the gap narrows to 1.1x — both pipelines are CoreML-predict-bound at that point.

4. **F vs CPU scales strongly with duration (5.0x -> 6.2x).** At 30s, CPU takes 2.2 seconds vs Swift's 349 ms.

5. **The 30s input (476 tokens) validates the Duration model expansion.** The T=512 Duration model handles 476 tokens correctly. Without the enumerated model export, this input would have been impossible (old T=128 model only supported ~120 real tokens after BOS/EOS).

## Bakeoff v4: Extended duration range (3s-30s) on M2 MacBook Air

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Same bakeoff v4 harness and frozen inputs as the M2 Ultra run, now on a base M2 MacBook Air (8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core ANE, 24 GB). Config A (Python HAR-post) remains the fastest pipeline on the M2 Air at longer durations, while Config F (Swift + CoreML) is faster only at short inputs (3s: 1.3x, 7s: 1.4x). At 15s and 30s, Config F is **slower** than Config A — a reversal of the M2 Ultra result. The bottleneck is GeneratorFromHar `predict()` via Swift's `MLModel.prediction()`, which runs **7.4x slower** than the equivalent Python `coremltools` call on the same 30s model.

### What was measured

- **Config A:** Shipping Python HAR-post hybrid (PyTorch prefix + CoreML decoder)
- **Config D:** PyTorch end-to-end on MPS (`PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`)
- **Config E:** PyTorch end-to-end on CPU
- **Config F:** Swift + CoreML pipeline (5 models + Swift hn-nsf DSP)

All configs used identical frozen inputs, `voice=af_heart`, `speed=1.0`, `torch.manual_seed(0)`.

### Method

`scripts/bakeoff_harness.py` with `run --configs a,d,e,f --iterations 5 --order-seed 0`. Counterbalanced ordering, models preloaded and warmed. `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` set. Config F ran in a separate pass due to warmup key fix; all models warmed before timed runs.

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| 15s | 276 ms | 554 ms | 2.0x slower |
| 30s | 435 ms | 854 ms | 2.0x slower |

### The GeneratorFromHar anomaly

The headline finding is that Config F's GeneratorFromHar `predict()` is dramatically slower on M2 Air than Config A's call to the *same* model at the same bucket size:

| Bucket | Config A (Python coremltools) | Config F (Swift MLModel) | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30s | 259 ms | 1971 ms | **7.6x** |

Both call the same `kokoro_decoder_har_post_30s.mlpackage`. The difference is the API layer:
- Config A: Python `coremltools.models.MLModel.predict()` 
- Config F: Swift `MLModel.prediction()` via subprocess

Possible explanations:
1. **Compute unit routing:** The Swift binary may not be requesting `computeUnits: .all` (ANE), forcing CPU/GPU fallback.
2. **Model compilation caching:** Each Swift subprocess may not benefit from the macOS model compilation cache the way a long-lived Python process does.
3. **Memory pressure:** The M2 Air's 24GB vs M2 Ultra's 64GB may cause memory-constrained scheduling differences.

This anomaly does **not** appear on M2 Ultra (Config F is 1.2x faster than A at 30s), suggesting it's specific to constrained hardware.

### Interpretation

1. **Config F wins at short durations (3s-7s) but loses at long durations (15s-30s) on M2 Air.** The crossover point is around 10s. This is the opposite of M2 Ultra where Config F wins everywhere.

2. **Config A scales consistently: 2.0x slower on Air vs Ultra** across all durations. This is expected given the ~2x difference in memory bandwidth and core count between M2 and M2 Ultra.

3. **Config F scales inconsistently: 2.6-6.5x slower on Air vs Ultra.** The GeneratorFromHar anomaly causes the gap to widen dramatically at longer durations (6.5x at 30s vs 2.6x at 7s).

4. **Config F still beats MPS (1.3-1.9x) and CPU (3.0-5.2x) everywhere.** The Swift pipeline is never the worst option — it just loses to the shipping Python HAR-post path at longer inputs on constrained hardware.

5. **For M2 Air deployment, use Config A for inputs > 10s.** Config F is only beneficial for short inputs. A hybrid routing strategy would be optimal.

## Bakeoff v5: Corrected benchmark (3s-30s) on M2 MacBook Air

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Reruns the v4 extended-duration bakeoff on M2 Air after fixing **critical measurement bugs** discovered in the audit:

1. **Config A only had 2 bucket models (3s, 10s)** — for 7s/15s/30s inputs, `_select_bucket_seconds` fell back to the 10s model. Config F had all 5 buckets. The v4 "Config F loses to Config A at long durations" was comparing different workloads.
2. **Swift F0Ntrain tFrames mapping was wrong** — hardcoded `400` for all non-3s buckets instead of `560/1200/2400`. This silently truncated 28-64% of aligned features for 15s/30s inputs.
3. **Duplicate matmul** inflated Config F wall time by one redundant 512×T×N matrix multiply.
4. **ANE plan compilation** could contaminate timed blocks after bucket-switch eviction.

With all bugs fixed, **Config F wins at every duration on M2 Air** — the v4 anomaly is eliminated.

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

### Cross-machine comparison (Config F)

| Input | M2 Ultra | M2 Air | Air/Ultra ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 65 ms | 200 ms | 3.1x slower |
| 7s | 142 ms | 326 ms | 2.3x slower |
| 15s | 254 ms | 783 ms | 3.1x slower |
| 30s | 349 ms | 1829 ms | 5.2x slower |

### Cross-machine comparison (Config A)

| Input | M2 Ultra | M2 Air | Air/Ultra ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 161 ms | 355 ms | 2.2x slower |
| 7s | 219 ms | 544 ms | 2.5x slower |
| 15s | 276 ms | 1178 ms | 4.3x slower |
| 30s | 435 ms | 2443 ms | 5.6x slower |

### What changed from v4

Config A at 15s went from 554 ms to 1178 ms (+624 ms) and at 30s from 854 ms to 2443 ms (+1589 ms) because it now runs the correct bucket model instead of the 10s fallback. Config F at 30s went from 2280 ms to 1829 ms (-451 ms) thanks to removing the duplicate matmul, fixing F0Ntrain truncation (which corrupted pitch predictions), and eliminating ANE plan compilation from timed blocks.

### The v4 "GeneratorFromHar anomaly" — debunked

The v4 finding that "Config F is slower than Config A at 15s/30s on M2 Air" was entirely an artifact of the bucket mismatch. Config A was running a 10s model for 15s/30s inputs while Config F ran the correctly-sized models. Additionally, Config F's F0Ntrain was fed truncated data (tFrames=400 instead of 1200/2400), producing corrupted pitch predictions that cascaded through the pipeline.

With fair bucket parity, Config F is **1.3-1.8x faster than Config A** at every duration on M2 Air, consistent with the M2 Ultra pattern.

### Interpretation

1. **Config F wins everywhere on M2 Air.** The v4 anomaly was a measurement bug, not a hardware limitation. The Swift+CoreML pipeline is 1.3-1.8x faster than Python HAR-post at all durations.

2. **GeneratorFromHar dominates at all durations.** It accounts for 79% of wall time at 3s and 80% at 30s. This is the primary optimization target.

3. **Config F achieves 14-21x realtime on M2 Air.** Peak throughput is at 7s (21x RT). The 30s input drops to 15x RT because GeneratorFromHar scales superlinearly with duration.

4. **Air/Ultra ratio for Config F is 2.3-5.2x.** This is wider than Config A's 2.2-5.6x ratio, but both show the same scaling pattern — the gap grows with duration because longer models stress the M2 Air's reduced ANE cores and memory bandwidth.

5. **Config D (MPS) OOM'd in the main run** due to memory pressure from loading 5 bucket CoreML models simultaneously. A separate MPS-only pass succeeded; results in table above. Config F beats MPS by 1.8-2.5x.

## Bakeoff v6: Full-pipeline re-export benchmark (3s-30s) on M2 MacBook Air

**First collected:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Re-ran the corrected v5 bakeoff on M2 Air after regenerating **every Core ML
package** from scratch (Duration T=32/64/128/256/512 padded + exact T=44/105/219/476,
F0Ntrain T=120/280/400/600/1200, DecoderPre {3,7,10,15,30}s, GeneratorFromHar
{3,7,10,15,30}s) on commit `fa2a24d`. Fixed a regression in
`export_synth/wrappers.py` where `CoreMLFriendlyTextEncoder.__init__` double-wrapped
the shared `kmodel.text_encoder.lstm` when `SynthesizerModel` was constructed after
`DurationModel`, failing GeneratorFromHar export with
`AttributeError: 'MaskedBidirectionalLSTM' object has no attribute 'num_layers'`.

**Config F wins at every duration.** End-to-end wall time is **185 ms for 3s audio
(15x realtime) and 3021 ms for 30s audio (9x realtime).** Config F beats Config A
by **1.3–2.5x** and CPU PyTorch by **2.5–4.6x**. MPS OOM'd on 15s and 30s even in
a solo pass (MPS pool cap ~27 GB vs 32 GB resident on this machine).

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | Bucket | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 2.80s | 3s | 461 ms | 739 ms | 723 ms | **185 ms** |

### Config F stage breakdown (warm median, ms)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duration CoreML | 10.6 ms | 12.8 ms | 39.6 ms | 48.5 ms |

| GeneratorFromHar CoreML | 159.1 ms | 348.9 ms | 1188.4 ms | 2780.1 ms |

### Delta vs v5 (M2 Air)

| Input | v5 F | v6 F | Δ F | v5 A | v6 A | Δ A |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 200 ms | 185 ms | **-8%** | 355 ms | 461 ms | +30% |
| 7s | 326 ms | 396 ms | +22% | 544 ms | 771 ms | +42% |
| 15s | 783 ms | 1326 ms | +69% | 1178 ms | 1896 ms | +61% |
| 30s | 1829 ms | 3021 ms | +65% | 2443 ms | 3918 ms | +60% |

GeneratorFromHar at 15s/30s went from 552/1471 ms (v5) to 1188/2780 ms (v6) —
roughly 2x slower. Both pipelines regressed at 7s+, but Config F regressed more
at longer buckets because GeneratorFromHar is the dominant stage.

Candidate causes (not yet isolated): (1) `torch==2.5.0` in this machine's
`requirements-bakeoff.txt` vs `torch==2.6.0` in the v5 provenance — different
tracing behavior may change MIL op selection; (2) thermal state after the
back-to-back export run that preceded the bakeoff (30s-bucket exports are
CPU-intensive); (3) variance in CoreML ANE plan compilation caching across
fresh `.mlpackage` directories. Re-running with a cold machine and matching
torch version is the next step to isolate this.

### Interpretation

1. **Config F still wins at every duration.** 185 ms for 3s (15x RT) and 3021 ms
   for 30s (9x RT) remain the best numbers across all four configs on this
   machine. Pitch parity and bucket geometry are intact after the full
   re-export.

2. **GeneratorFromHar dominates Config F wall time more than ever.** It accounts
   for 86% of wall time at 3s and 92% at 30s — up from 79–80% in v5. Any further
   optimization must target this package; everything else is already sub-100 ms.

3. **MPS (Config D) is unusable on 24 GB M2 Air for 15s+ inputs.** Even in a solo
   pass with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` and no other configs loaded, the
   MPS pool cap (27 GB) conflicts with the 32 GB already allocated for this
   process. The production app should never route to MPS on this hardware.

4. **15s/30s regression vs v5 is real and worth investigating.** The +60-70%
   delta on GeneratorFromHar is large enough that it cannot be attributed to
   run-to-run variance (5 iterations, medians). Likely attribution: torch 2.5
   vs 2.6 export, thermal state, or both.

5. **Config D partial data is retained rather than dropped.** 3s/7s still
   provide an apples-to-apples MPS baseline; 15s/30s MPS numbers are marked OOM.

- Export fix: `export_synth/wrappers.py` — `CoreMLFriendlyTextEncoder.__init__`

## Bakeoff v2: Controlled benchmark on M1 Mini

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Same bakeoff harness and frozen inputs as the M2 Ultra and M2 Air runs, now on a base M1 Mac Mini (8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core ANE, 16 GB). Config A (shipping HAR-post) is **2.3–4.8x faster than PyTorch CPU** and **6–14x realtime**. CoreML `predict()` consumes 50–51% of wall time on the 10s bucket and 40–42% on the 3s bucket — a balanced split between CPU-side overhead and CoreML inference, similar to the M2 Air pattern.

### What was measured

- **Config A:** Shipping hybrid HAR-post path (`coreml/kokoro_decoder_har_post_{3,10}s.mlpackage`)
- **Config B:** Naive decoder-only 10s artifact, `compute_units=ALL`
- **Config C:** Naive decoder-only 10s artifact, `compute_units=CPU_AND_GPU`
- **Config D:** PyTorch end-to-end on MPS (`PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`)
- **Config E:** PyTorch end-to-end on CPU

All configs used identical frozen inputs, `voice=af_heart`, `speed=1.0`, `torch.manual_seed(0)`.

### Method

Same as M2 Ultra run: `scripts/bakeoff_harness.py` with `run --configs a,b,c,d,e --iterations 5 --order-seed 0`. Counterbalanced ordering, models preloaded and warmed. `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` set for the full run (Config D).

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | A (HAR-post) | B (.all) | C (.cpuAndGPU) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `1.55s` | `259 ms` | `1589 ms` | `1556 ms` | `360 ms` | `601 ms` |
| `short` | `2.80s` | `240 ms` | `1561 ms` | `1577 ms` | `750 ms` | `896 ms` |
| `medium` | `6.58s` | `603 ms` | `1624 ms` | `1598 ms` | `1025 ms` | `2223 ms` |
| `long` | `8.35s` | `600 ms` | `1628 ms` | `1625 ms` | `1257 ms` | `2849 ms` |

### RTF (canonical audio duration / wall time)

| Input | A (HAR-post) | B (.all) | C (.cpuAndGPU) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `0.167` (6x RT) | `1.025` | `1.004` | `0.232` | `0.388` |
| `short` | `0.086` (12x RT) | `0.557` | `0.563` | `0.268` | `0.320` |
| `medium` | `0.092` (11x RT) | `0.247` | `0.243` | `0.156` | `0.338` |
| `long` | `0.072` (14x RT) | `0.195` | `0.195` | `0.151` | `0.341` |

### Speedup: Config A vs PyTorch baselines

| Input | Audio | A vs E (CPU) | A vs D (MPS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `1.55s` | `2.3x` | `1.4x` |
| `short` | `2.80s` | `3.7x` | `3.1x` |
| `medium` | `6.58s` | `3.7x` | `1.7x` |
| `long` | `8.35s` | `4.8x` | `2.1x` |

### Config A stage breakdown (warm median)

| Input | Bucket | Prefix extract | HAR builder (CPU) | CoreML predict | Orchestration | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `3s` | `67.3 ms` (26%) | `74.2 ms` (29%) | `102.4 ms` (40%) | `2.1 ms` | `259 ms` |
| `short` | `3s` | `73.5 ms` (31%) | `64.3 ms` (27%) | `100.6 ms` (42%) | `1.6 ms` | `240 ms` |
| `medium` | `10s` | `131.4 ms` (22%) | `153.6 ms` (25%) | `310.4 ms` (51%) | `2.1 ms` | `603 ms` |
| `long` | `10s` | `149.2 ms` (25%) | `149.4 ms` (25%) | `298.0 ms` (50%) | `1.6 ms` | `600 ms` |

### Interpretation

1. **Config A is 6–14x realtime on M1 Mini.** The shortest input (`tiny`, 1.55s audio) completes in 259 ms; the longest (`long`, 8.35s audio) in 600 ms. Roughly 1.7–2.2x slower than M2 Ultra, similar to M2 Air.

2. **CoreML predict scales with bucket size.** On the 3s bucket, predict is ~100 ms (40% of wall time). On the 10s bucket, predict jumps to ~300 ms (50% of wall time). CPU-side overhead (prefix + HAR builder) stays proportional to input length regardless of bucket.

3. **Speedup vs CPU scales strongly with duration.** The 2.3x speedup at `tiny` grows to 4.8x at `long` — matching the M2 Air scaling curve and exceeding M2 Ultra's 1.7x → 3.5x range. PyTorch CPU scales linearly with sequence length while CoreML predict is sublinear.

4. **MPS shows high variance.** Config D (MPS) has significant run-to-run variation (std up to 1.8s on `medium`), consistent with `aten::angle` fallback and thermal throttling. Treat as directional only.

5. **Configs B and C remain indistinguishable.** Both hover around 1.55–1.63s regardless of input length, consistent with all other machines. ANE participation under `.all` remains **indeterminate** without powermetrics telemetry.

6. **No OOM on 16 GB.** All five configs loaded and ran successfully on the M1 Mini's 16 GB unified memory. This resolves the Phase 4 deferral in the bakeoff plan — M1 Mini is viable as a benchmark target.

### Cross-machine comparison: M1 Mini vs M2 Air vs M2 Ultra

| Input | M1 Mini A | M2 Air A | M2 Ultra A | M1/Ultra | M1 Mini E | M2 Air E | M2 Ultra E | M1/Ultra |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `259 ms` | `329 ms` | `151 ms` | `1.7x` | `601 ms` | `436 ms` | `258 ms` | `2.3x` |
| `short` | `240 ms` | `323 ms` | `155 ms` | `1.5x` | `896 ms` | `819 ms` | `396 ms` | `2.3x` |
| `medium` | `603 ms` | `521 ms` | `283 ms` | `2.1x` | `2223 ms` | `1929 ms` | `782 ms` | `2.8x` |
| `long` | `600 ms` | `513 ms` | `274 ms` | `2.2x` | `2849 ms` | `2441 ms` | `966 ms` | `2.9x` |

Config A on M1 Mini is 1.5–2.2x slower than M2 Ultra and surprisingly close to M2 Air (within 20% on short inputs, ~15% slower on long inputs). The M1 Mini's CoreML predict is ~100 ms on the 3s bucket (vs M2 Air's 220 ms and M2 Ultra's 19–57 ms), suggesting the M1's 16-core ANE handles the small bucket efficiently. On the 10s bucket, predict jumps to ~300 ms, closer to the M2 Air's 260 ms. PyTorch CPU is 2.3–2.9x slower than M2 Ultra, consistent with the M1 → M2 Ultra compute gap.

Same bakeoff harness and frozen inputs as the M2 Ultra run above, now on a consumer M2 MacBook Air (8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core ANE, 24 GB). Config A (shipping HAR-post) is **2.5–4.8x faster than PyTorch CPU** on medium-to-long inputs and **5–16x realtime**. CoreML `predict()` is substantially slower than on M2 Ultra (234–262 ms vs 19–84 ms), now consuming 50–71% of wall time — the bottleneck has shifted from CPU-side overhead to CoreML inference on this lower-end chip.

### What was measured

- **Config A:** Shipping hybrid HAR-post path (`coreml/kokoro_decoder_har_post_{3,10}s.mlpackage`)
- **Config B:** Naive decoder-only 10s artifact, `compute_units=ALL`
- **Config C:** Naive decoder-only 10s artifact, `compute_units=CPU_AND_GPU`
- **Config D:** PyTorch end-to-end on MPS (`PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`)
- **Config E:** PyTorch end-to-end on CPU

All configs used identical frozen inputs, `voice=af_heart`, `speed=1.0`, `torch.manual_seed(0)`.

### Method

Same as M2 Ultra run: `scripts/bakeoff_harness.py` with `run --configs a,b,c,d,e --iterations 5 --order-seed 0`. Counterbalanced ordering, models preloaded and warmed. Config D was run in a separate pass with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` set.

### Speedup: Config A vs PyTorch baselines

| Input | Audio | A vs E (CPU) | A vs D (MPS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `1.55s` | `1.3x` | `0.6x` (MPS faster) |
| `short` | `2.80s` | `2.5x` | `1.0x` |
| `medium` | `6.58s` | `3.7x` | `1.3x` |
| `long` | `8.35s` | `4.8x` | `1.7x` |

### Config A stage breakdown (warm median)

| Input | Bucket | Prefix extract | HAR builder (CPU) | CoreML predict | Orchestration | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `3s` | `46.9 ms` (14%) | `45.8 ms` (14%) | `234.0 ms` (71%) | `1.8 ms` | `329 ms` |
| `short` | `3s` | `64.9 ms` (20%) | `46.4 ms` (14%) | `220.5 ms` (68%) | `1.8 ms` | `323 ms` |
| `medium` | `10s` | `107.4 ms` (21%) | `123.5 ms` (24%) | `262.3 ms` (50%) | `1.8 ms` | `521 ms` |
| `long` | `10s` | `137.5 ms` (27%) | `113.7 ms` (22%) | `259.6 ms` (51%) | `1.8 ms` | `513 ms` |

### Interpretation

1. **Config A is 5–16x realtime on M2 Air.** The shortest input (`tiny`, 1.55s audio) completes in 329 ms; the longest (`long`, 8.35s audio) in 513 ms. Roughly 2x slower than M2 Ultra across the board.

2. **CoreML predict is now the bottleneck.** On M2 Ultra, CPU-side overhead dominated (62–86% of wall time). On M2 Air, CoreML `predict()` takes 220–262 ms (50–71% of wall time), while prefix extract + HAR builder are roughly similar to M2 Ultra. The M2 Air's 16-core ANE (vs Ultra's 32-core) and lower memory bandwidth explain the shift.

3. **Speedup vs CPU scales with duration.** The 1.3x speedup at `tiny` grows to 4.8x at `long` — even steeper scaling than M2 Ultra (1.7x → 3.5x) because PyTorch CPU is proportionally slower on M2 Air while CoreML predict stays relatively flat.

4. **MPS is surprisingly competitive on short inputs.** Config D (PyTorch MPS) beats Config A on `tiny` (194 ms vs 329 ms) and ties on `short`. Config A only pulls ahead at `medium` (1.3x) and `long` (1.7x). This is the opposite of M2 Ultra where MPS was consistently slower — suggesting the M2 Air's 10-core GPU handles this workload well, and the CoreML predict overhead (220–260 ms) is the limiter on short inputs.

5. **Configs B and C remain indistinguishable.** Both hover around 1.4–1.5s regardless of input length, consistent with M2 Ultra. ANE participation under `.all` remains **indeterminate** without powermetrics telemetry.

### Cross-machine comparison: M2 Air vs M2 Ultra

| Input | M2 Air A | M2 Ultra A | Air/Ultra | M2 Air D | M2 Ultra D | Air/Ultra | M2 Air E | M2 Ultra E | Air/Ultra |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | `329 ms` | `151 ms` | `2.2x` | `194 ms` | `215 ms` | `0.9x` | `436 ms` | `258 ms` | `1.7x` |
| `short` | `323 ms` | `155 ms` | `2.1x` | `329 ms` | `287 ms` | `1.1x` | `819 ms` | `396 ms` | `2.1x` |
| `medium` | `521 ms` | `283 ms` | `1.8x` | `682 ms` | `351 ms` | `1.9x` | `1929 ms` | `782 ms` | `2.5x` |
| `long` | `513 ms` | `274 ms` | `1.9x` | `860 ms` | `436 ms` | `2.0x` | `2441 ms` | `966 ms` | `2.5x` |

Config A scales roughly 2x between Air and Ultra. PyTorch CPU scales 1.7–2.5x. MPS (Config D) is nearly identical on short inputs across both machines but diverges on longer ones — consistent with the Ultra's larger GPU providing more parallelism for longer sequences. The CoreML path degrades more gracefully than CPU because the CPU-side prefix cost is similar on both machines — only the predict portion scales with ANE core count.

### Switching penalty analysis

The counterbalanced ordering shuffles configs between repetitions, so Config A sometimes runs immediately after B/C (decoder-only), potentially paying ANE model-reload costs. Per-iteration predict times, grouped by Config A's position in the execution order:

| Config A position | Mean predict | Median predict | N |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Position 0 (runs first) | `225 ms` | `226 ms` | 4 |
| Position 2+ (after B/C) | `241 ms` | `242 ms` | 15 |

**Switching penalty: ~16 ms (~7%).** The ANE likely reloads the HAR-post model plan after running the decoder-only model, but the cost is small.

One outlier was excluded: `medium` on iteration 0 spiked to `2101 ms` predict (vs typical 237–275 ms). This is a one-time ANE compilation hit for the 10s bucket — the warmup pass may not have fully compiled the 10s model for all input shapes. Every subsequent `medium` run was normal regardless of position.

**Conclusion:** ~93% of the M2 Air vs M2 Ultra gap is real compute (16 vs 32 ANE cores, lower memory bandwidth). The counterbalanced switching penalty adds ~7% noise to predict times but does not explain the cross-machine difference.

### Interpretation

### M1 Mini data (2026-04-15)

Config A (HAR-post), D (MPS), E (CPU) collected. Config F (Swift) not available — input manifest used legacy keys (`tiny/short/medium/long`) incompatible with Swift benchmark's `3s/7s/15s/30s` inputs. Requires re-running `prepare-inputs` with updated harness to align input keys.

#### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

#### Interpretation

1. **Config A is 7–14x realtime on M1 Mini.** Consistent with the earlier bakeoff v2 M1 Mini results (6-14x RT), confirming the M1 Mini as a viable benchmark target.

2. **MPS is consistently slower than Config A.** Unlike the M2 Air where MPS beat Config A on `tiny`, the M1 Mini's 8-core GPU never outperforms the hybrid CoreML path. Config A's advantage is 1.3–2.0x across all inputs.

3. **Speedup vs CPU scales with duration.** The 2.2x speedup at `tiny` grows to 4.5x at `long` — consistent with M2 Ultra and M2 Air scaling patterns.

4. **CoreML predict is ~100 ms on the 3s bucket and ~300 ms on the 10s bucket.** Same pattern as the earlier v2 run, confirming stable predict-time behavior on this machine.

#### Provenance

- Machine: Apple M1 Mac Mini, 16 GB
- Git: `97c394526f69`
- Torch: `2.6.0` / coremltools: `9.0` / numpy: `1.26.4`
- Order seed: `0`, iterations: `5`
- Results: `outputs/bakeoff/results_m1_mini.json`
- Note: Config F (Swift) unavailable due to input key mismatch between manifest and Swift benchmark. Non-essential models stashed during run to fit in 16 GB.

Key questions this section will answer when Config F data is collected:
1. Does the Swift pipeline speedup vs MPS hold on lower-end hardware, or does MPS become competitive as the GPU handles more of the work?
2. On the M2 Air where MPS was competitive with Config A on short inputs (bakeoff v2), does Config F still win?
3. How does the M1 Mini's 8-core GPU (MPS) compare to its 16-core ANE (Swift+CoreML)?

## Bakeoff v5: Corrected benchmark (3s-30s) on M1 Mac Mini

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Same corrected v5 harness as the M2 Air run (all audit bugs fixed: bucket parity, tFrames mapping, duplicate matmul, ANE plan compilation), now on the lowest-spec Apple Silicon tested: M1 Mac Mini (8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core ANE, 16 GB). Configs D, E, F were run together; Config A was run separately (it OOMed when loaded alongside D+E due to 5 HAR-post CoreML models + 2 PyTorch models in 16 GB).

**Config F wins at every duration on M1 Mini**, achieving **18–22x realtime**. Config F is **1.1–1.5x faster than Config A** — a tighter margin than M2 Air (1.3–1.8x) but consistent across all durations.

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

### Config A stage breakdown (warm median)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 3s | 86 ms (36%) | 57 ms (24%) | 96 ms (40%) | 238 ms |

| 30s | 30s | 409 ms (25%) | 364 ms (22%) | 858 ms (52%) | 1637 ms |

### Interpretation

1. **Config F is 18–22x realtime on M1 Mini** — the lowest-spec Apple Silicon we've tested. Even 30s of audio completes in 1.2 seconds. This confirms the Swift+CoreML pipeline is viable on all shipping Apple Silicon Macs.

2. **Config F beats Config A at every duration**, 1.1–1.5x faster. The margin is tighter than M2 Air (1.3–1.8x), consistent with the M1's smaller ANE/CPU gap — both pipelines are more ANE-bound here.

3. **Config F is 4.4–7.3x faster than PyTorch CPU and 2.0–3.4x faster than MPS.** The CPU speedup is the largest we've seen on any machine, because the M1's CPU is the weakest tested while the ANE remains competitive.

4. **CoreML predict dominates Config A at longer durations.** At 30s, predict is 858 ms (52% of wall time) — the CPU-side prefix (409 ms) and HAR builder (364 ms) are also substantial. Config F avoids both Python-side costs.

5. **The Swift pipeline's model eviction strategy is essential for 16 GB.** Config A could only run in isolation (not alongside D+E). The production app should follow Config F's pattern of loading one bucket at a time.

## External bakeoff follow-up: laishere fp16 vocoder interface probe

**First collected:** 2026-06-06
**Status:** Rejected as optimization path

Source audit showed laishere's `KokoroVocoder` uses fp16 Core ML inputs,
`CPU_AND_NE`, and int8-palettized weights, while our first-party split probes
had declared the same body boundary as fp32. `scripts/probe_f0_noise_exact_shape.py`
and `scripts/probe_decoder_vocoder_split.py` now expose `--body-input-dtype` so
that interface contract can be reproduced explicitly.

On local M2 Studio 3s, the F0-source split with fp16 body inputs is not a win:

| Variant | Baseline total | Candidate total | Candidate noise | Candidate body | Candidate tail | Corr | SNR |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Both variants fail the strict quality gate and are far slower than the current
warm generator path. Package inspection shows the palettized body shrank from
`97.8 MB` to `49.2 MB` and gained `101` LUT ops, but runtime stayed pinned at
~`214 ms` for the body. This closes the "we missed laishere's fp16/palette
vocoder contract" hypothesis for the current static 3s export.

The same fp16-input + palettized-body probe converted with `--deployment-target
ios17` was slower again: baseline `34.34 ms`, candidate `265.89 ms`, body
`256.57 ms`, corr `0.930895`, SNR `9.13 dB`. Deployment target alone is not the
missing laishere speed ingredient for this static-body probe.

The laishere-style math rewrite remains speed-relevant: with `--cos-snake
--patch-resblock-scale`, the same F0-source split is slightly faster at local
3s (`30.63 ms` vs `30.88 ms`) and faster at local 7s (`57.03 ms` vs
`61.26 ms`, +6.9%). It still fails strict waveform quality (`3s` corr
`0.931895`, SNR `9.19 dB`; `7s` corr `0.962251`, SNR `11.51 dB`). This is the
current best speed-positive source/vocoder research branch, but it is not
production-eligible until source quality is recovered or a human listening gate
accepts the drift.

A 3s rerun with `--include-torch-reference` shows the quality loss is already
present before Core ML: baseline vs dump is corr `0.999996`, SNR `51.60 dB`,
while the PyTorch F0-source candidate vs dump is corr `0.939812`, SNR
`9.57 dB`. The next optimization work should recover the source formulation or
accept/reject the drift by listening review; more conversion flags are unlikely
to solve this branch.

Rendered a no-ASR listening pack for the 3s and 7s cos/residual speed branch at
`outputs/f0_source_listening/cos_resblock_speed_branch/README.md`. Both
candidates are `needs_listening` with no waveform-health reject reasons. This
does not approve the branch; it creates the human review artifact the user
requested after skipping Whisper/ASR.

Phase-mode recovery was tested and rejected for the 3s cos/residual F0-source
branch. `scripts/probe_f0_noise_exact_shape.py` now supports `--phase-mode`;
`acos` gave the best alternate result (candidate `32.54 ms` vs baseline
`32.79 ms`, corr `0.949566`, SNR `10.34 dB`) but still failed strict quality.
`atan_swift` preserved speed but worsened quality (corr `0.915815`, SNR
`7.44 dB`). The next step is source formulation or listening acceptance, not
more phase branch tuning.

The source formulation gap is now proven. `scripts/probe_f0_source_variants.py`
has a `swift_like_seeded` variant that matches dumped Swift `har_source` at
essentially perfect parity (`3s` SNR `138.15 dB`, `7s` SNR `139.65 dB`). The
deterministic CoreML-friendly/laishere-style source stays at corr `0.93978`
for 3s and `0.96731` for 7s. Laishere is faster partly because it moves this
source work into a simplified Core ML graph; that is not strict-equivalent to
our current seeded Double-accumulator Swift HnSF contract.

Keeping exact Swift HAR and only splitting the laishere-style noise/body/tail
is not a win locally. The exact-HAR cos/residual split passes quality, but is
slower: 3s `36.76 ms` vs `32.07 ms`, and 7s `67.72 ms` vs `60.88 ms`. That path
is rejected for production unless a lower-end remote device contradicts the
local result.

## Bakeoff v5: Corrected benchmark (3s-30s) on M2 Ultra

**First collected:** 2026-04-15
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Reran the corrected v5 bakeoff on M2 Ultra after the same audit fixes used for
the M2 Air and M1 Mini runs: bucket parity, corrected Swift F0Ntrain frame
mapping, duplicate matmul removal, and ANE plan compilation kept out of timed
blocks. All four configs completed successfully across all four inputs.

**Config F wins at every duration on M2 Ultra**, achieving **48-70x realtime**.
The margin over Config A is largest at 3s (2.0x) and tightest at 15s (1.1x),
while Config F remains **2.2-3.0x faster than MPS** and **3.5-4.4x faster than
CPU** across the corrected duration range.

### End-to-end wall time (warm median, milliseconds)

| Input | Audio | Bucket | A (Python HAR) | D (MPS) | E (CPU) | F (Swift) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 2.80s | 3s | 117 ms | 176 ms | 255 ms | **59 ms** |
| 7s | 6.75s | 7s | 179 ms | 319 ms | 501 ms | **136 ms** |
| 15s | 13.90s | 15s | 309 ms | 602 ms | 975 ms | **278 ms** |
| 30s | 27.38s | 30s | 555 ms | 1233 ms | 1870 ms | **422 ms** |

### RTF and realtime factor

| Input | Audio | A RTF | D RTF | E RTF | F RTF | F realtime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | 2.80s | 0.042 (24x RT) | 0.063 | 0.091 | **0.021** | **48x RT** |
| 7s | 6.75s | 0.027 (38x RT) | 0.047 | 0.074 | **0.020** | **50x RT** |
| 15s | 13.90s | 0.022 (45x RT) | 0.043 | 0.070 | **0.020** | **50x RT** |
| 30s | 27.38s | 0.020 (49x RT) | 0.045 | 0.068 | **0.015** | **70x RT** |

### Speedup: Config F vs baselines

| Input | F vs A (Python HAR) | F vs D (MPS) | F vs E (CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3s | **2.0x** | **3.0x** | **4.3x** |
| 7s | **1.3x** | **2.3x** | **3.7x** |
| 15s | **1.1x** | **2.2x** | **3.5x** |
| 30s | **1.3x** | **2.9x** | **4.4x** |

### Interpretation

1. **Config F wins everywhere on M2 Ultra.** The corrected Swift+CoreML path is
   faster than Python HAR-post, MPS, and CPU for all measured durations.

2. **The MPS gap remains large.** Config F is 2.2-3.0x faster than the PyTorch
   MPS baseline, preserving the core bakeoff result that the Swift+CoreML path
   beats the "just use the GPU" path.

3. **The Config A margin is now more conservative than v4.** With corrected
   bucket parity and v5 fixes, Config F is 1.1-2.0x faster than Config A. The
   15s/30s results are close enough that future optimization work should focus
   on stage-level costs rather than assuming large end-to-end headroom.

4. **Config F remains extremely realtime.** Even the 30s input completes in
   422 ms, roughly 70x realtime on M2 Ultra.

### Provenance

- Machine: Apple M2 Ultra, 64 GB, macOS 26.4.1
- Git: main branch, commit `f9276800`
- Python: 3.12.13
- Torch: 2.6.0 / coremltools: 8.3.0
- Order seed: 0, iterations: 5
- Results: `outputs/bakeoff/results_m2_ultra_v5.json`
- Note: Config F batch harness required the stdout sentinel parser fix in
  `scripts/bakeoff_harness.py` because Core ML may emit ANE diagnostics on the
  same stdout line as `DONE`.
